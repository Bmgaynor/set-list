Willie Nelson has earned every conceivable award as a musician and amassed reputable credentials as an author, actor, and activist. He continues to&nbsp;thrive as a relevant and progressive musical and cultural force. In recent years, he has delivered more than a dozen new album releases, released a Top 10&nbsp;<em>New York Times<\/em>&rsquo; bestsellers book, again headlined Farm Aid, an event he co-founded in 1985, received his 5th degree&nbsp;black belt in Gong Kwon Yu Sul, headlined the annual Luck Reunion food and music festival at his ranch in Luck, TX during SXSW, launched his cannabis companies Willie&rsquo;s Reserve and Willie&rsquo;s Remedy, and graced the covers of Rolling Stone and AARP The Magazine. In 2015, Nelson published &ldquo;It&rsquo;s A Long Story: My Life,&rdquo;&nbsp;the unvarnished and complete story of his life that landed him on the&nbsp;<em>New York Times&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/em>bestsellers list. He also released a new studio album with Merle Haggard titled&nbsp;<em>Django And Jimmie,&nbsp;<\/em>which debuted at #1 on&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&lsquo;s Country album chart and #7 on&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&lsquo;s Top 200 album chart. In November 2015, the Library of Congress honored him with their Gershwin Prize for Popular Song for his contributions to popular music. He is the first country artist to receive the distinguished award. The following year began with the release of&nbsp;<em>Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin<\/em>, a collection of 11 newly recorded Gershwin classics. The album debuted at #1 on both the Top Current Jazz chart and the Top Traditional Jazz chart, as well as earned him a Grammy Award for the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. In September 2016, came&nbsp;<em>For the Good Times: A Tribute to Ray Price,&nbsp;<\/em>an album of&nbsp;newly recorded interpretations of 12 Ray Price songs.&nbsp;In 2017, he released two albums of newly recorded performances:&nbsp;<em>God&rsquo;s&nbsp;Problem Child<\/em>, with 13 new songs&nbsp;that debuted at #1 on&nbsp;<em>Billboard&rsquo;s&nbsp;<\/em>Country album chart and #10 on the&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&nbsp;200, and&nbsp;<em>Willie Nelson and The Boys (Willie&rsquo;s Stash, Vol. 2),&nbsp;<\/em>that includes&nbsp;11 country classics and one brand-new song performed by Nelson and his sons&nbsp;Lukas and Micah.

In this case, it was the unique environment that he fostered at Terrapin Crossroads, the music venue that he recently opened in Marin County, CA.<br \/><br \/>Using the Grateful Dead songbook as a springboard for reinterpretation and as inspiration to create original material, the TFB musicians were inspired as much by one another as they were by the diverse group of influences that they brought to the table; as a result, the music conveyed friendship, respect, warmth, and companionship for listeners and performers alike.<br \/><br \/>'Family' isn't just a moniker for the group, either. The first person that Phil brought on was Grahame Lesh, his son. From the beginning Grahame's guitar chops, powerful vocals and harmonic touch helped form the backbone of the band's sound.<br \/><br \/>Keeping with the family theme is Alex Koford, a long time family friend whom Phil recruited to be his drummer. It quickly became apparent that Alex had a voice to match his drumming ability, and before long he was pulling a 'Levon Helm,' delivering soaring vocal leads while pounding away on the drums.<br \/><br \/>Then, there is the man of many talents, Jason Crosby. He started playing violin at the age of 2, discovered he had perfect pitch not longer thereafter, and then proceeded to master virtually every instrument known to man. You can usually find him on the piano or violin with the Terrapin Family Band, adding a delicate touch here, a perfect note there.<br \/><br \/>Last, but certainly not least, is our very own Ross James. The dynamic, bearded guitarist wowed crowds from the moment he burst onto the scene at Terrapin Crossroads, and it wasn't long before his distinct sound and style were as recognizable at Terrapin as Phil's bass bombs. Combine Ross with the two Lesh men, and you've got about as electric a musical front-court as you can find anywhere.<br \/><br \/>Over time, the band&rsquo;s music has developed organically, merging and fusing each musician&rsquo;s influences (including rock, folk, punk, jazz, metal, psychedelic, experimental, classical) into a hard-rockin&rsquo; sound rooted in the communal\/collective, telepathic, exploratory spirit of the Grateful Dead.<br \/><br \/>What began as a house band for Phil&rsquo;s Terrapin Crossroads has turned into something much more, and the band is excited to take the unique Terrapin Family Band sound outside of their home turf as they explore new musical grounds.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PhilLeshFriends_3_59_03_PM_4_16_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 27 - 8:15 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 27","start_time":"8:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TerrapinFamilyBand"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/terrapinfamilyband\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/txrfamilyband"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.terrapinfamilyband.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/outlaw-music-festival\/event\/07005661D64579D6"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/30\/2019 10:48:38 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-avett-brothers":{"id":"5331","name":"The Avett Brothers","friendly_url":"the-avett-brothers","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>Hailing from Concord, NC, The Avett Brothers? released their first album in 2002, and won the Americana Music Association&rsquo;s Emerging Artist Award AND Duo\/Group of the Year Award in 2007 (and two more times since.)&nbsp; They first made mainstream waves with their 2009 major label debut,&nbsp;<em>I and Love and You<\/em>, landing at #16 on the&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&nbsp;Top 200 and garnering critical acclaim from&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone,<\/em><em>&nbsp;New York Times, Los Angeles Times<\/em>, and&nbsp;<em>Time<\/em>.

Shortly after, Krauss began entering fiddle contests. At the age of 14, Rounder Records signed her to her first record deal and she went on to release her debut solo album two years later. The accomplished bluegrass musician became a member of the Grand Ole Opry at age 21.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1985, Krauss has released 14 albums including five solo, seven with her longtime band and musical collaborators Union Station, and the Robert Plant collaboration&nbsp;<em>Raising Sand<\/em>, which was certified platinum and won five Grammys, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year.&nbsp;She&rsquo;s sold more than 12 million records to date, and her honors include 27 Grammys, nine Country Music Association awards, 14 International Bluegrass Music Association Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards and two Gospel Music Association awards.<\/p>\n<p><em>Windy City<\/em>, her latest solo album, debuted at No. 1 on the&nbsp;<em>Billboard&nbsp;<\/em>Top Country Albums and Top Bluegrass Albums charts and received two Grammy nominations. The album was produced by Buddy Cannon, whose vocal harmonies Krauss grew up listening to and were the soundtrack to her childhood. &ldquo;Buddy sang harmonies on everything back then,&rdquo; Krauss says. She also reveals of Cannon, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do something unless I feel like I&rsquo;m called to do it. That&rsquo;s what I felt like, so I honored it. It&rsquo;s like the same feeling of when you know something is right musically, with a song or a batch of songs &ndash; the same feeling, but this was attached to a person instead of a batch of songs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Krauss frequently collaborates with artists from numerous genres, including Dolly Parton, Taylor Swift, Kenny Rogers, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Vince Gill, The Chieftains, James Taylor, The Cox Family, Yo-Yo Ma, Johnny Mathis, Cyndi Lauper, Heart, Bad Company and Phish. She has recorded and toured with Willie Nelson, whom she honored with a performance during the 2015 Gershwin Prize Tribute Concert. She will reunite with Nelson this summer on a co-headlining tour throughout North America. &ldquo;Whiskey Lullaby,&rdquo; a duet which she performed with Brad Paisley won two CMA Awards in 2004. She has also produced albums for Alan Jackson, Nickel Creek and The Cox Family. Some of these collaborators were also formative to Krauss and she lists influences including Tony Rice, Ricky Skaggs, Dolly Parton, Larry Sparks, The Cox Family, and Ralph Stanley.<\/p>\n<p>Krauss has contributed songs to numerous films, including &ldquo;Down to the River to Pray&rdquo; in &nbsp;the cult classic film&nbsp;<em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?<\/em>&nbsp;and &ldquo;You Will Be My Ain True Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Scarlett Tide&rdquo; in the film&nbsp;<em>Cold Mountain<\/em>.

That small army of rogues and rebels, drifters and dreamers, soldiers and schemers populate his songs, their tragedies and comedies, their lives and deaths recalled in his finely etched musical vignettes.<\/p>\n<p>The Minnesota-born, Wisconsin-based tunesmith and teller of tales (both tall and true), just returned? ?with his second effort&nbsp;<em>Rangers &amp; Valentines<\/em>&nbsp;(Xtra Mile Recordings). The record follows his critically acclaimed 2012 debut&nbsp;<em>Run Engine, Run<\/em>. That LP earned notices in Rolling Stone, American Songwriter and Paste, with the folks at Huffington Post calling him a &ldquo;master storyteller&rdquo; and PBS hailing his &ldquo;story songs that explore and explode the conventions of rock and roll.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On&nbsp;<em>Rangers &amp; Valentines<\/em>, Schoepp defies the limitations of the standard-issue Americana platter, hopping genres &ndash; you&rsquo;ll hear lots of brass, backing singers and B-3 &mdash; as the songs build to delirious musical highs. His narratives, meanwhile, find subjects in the narrow margins of society, the strange twists (literal and metaphorical) in the weather, and the vagaries of a troubadour&rsquo;s transient life &ndash; with lyrics that flash a lacerating wit and humanist streak that&rsquo;s at the core of his craft.<\/p>\n<p>Produced by pop polymath and Raconteurs member Brendan Benson&nbsp;at his Readymade Studios in Nashville, the record finds Schoepp handling vocals, guitar and harmonica. He&rsquo;s aided by an array of estimable musicians including his brother and musical-foil-since-birth Tanner Schoepp (providing bass guitar and vocal harmonies),&nbsp;Steve Selvidge (The Hold Steady), John Davis (Superdrag), the McCrary Sisters&nbsp;&mdash; even comedian and&nbsp;<em>WTF&nbsp;<\/em>podcaster&nbsp;Marc Maron&nbsp;chips in on background vocals and lead guitar.<\/p>\n<p>Schoepp shines up the well-worn clich&eacute;s of singer-songwriterdom and renders them anew. Evoking a series of vivid protagonists and settings, his work variously recalls prime Prine (John, that is), the nuances of Newman (Randy, of course), the boozy bonhomie of The Replacements, and the unflinching language of someone well-versed in the Zevonian dialect.<\/p>\n<p>Schoepp mixes fact and family lore to conjure the hardscrabble history &ldquo;Ballad of Olof Johnson&rdquo; and chides modern-day wannabes on &ldquo;Lost Cowboy.&rdquo; The road story &ldquo;Ogalalla&rdquo; answers the question: what happens to your mind when you&rsquo;re snowbound in Nebraska with nothing but a bottle of Nyquil and&nbsp;<em>The Hobbit<\/em>&nbsp;at the local picture show for company? Meanwhile, the arch love song satire &ldquo;Talking Girlfriend Blues&rdquo; deftly explains how to preserve your dignity while hitchhiking to a date &ndash; and what to do when your ride turns out to have eyes for the same girl.<\/p>\n<p>Last summer Schoepp also released&nbsp;<em>Bay Beach Amusement Park<\/em>, a six-song concept album centered around the 125-year-old attraction located in Green Bay, WI on the shores of Lake Michigan. Recorded mostly live over a weekend at Pachyderm Studios, Bay Beach Amusement Park serves as Schoepp&rsquo;s creative and wildly fun follow-up to Rangers &amp; Valentines, an album Relix declared a &ldquo;mini masterpiece&rdquo; and named one of Billboard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best of the Week.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the park&rsquo;s most historic and notable attraction is the Zippin Pippin, a wooden rollercoaster known famously as Elvis Presley&rsquo;s favorite ride. The King rented Libertyland on August 8, 1977 from 1:15 a.m. until 7 a.m. to entertain a group of guests. Decked in a blue jumpsuit with a black leather belt, huge belt buckle with turquoise studs and gold chains, the King rode the Pippin repeatedly during a two-hour period. Presley&rsquo;s late night joyride was his last public appearance. He passed away eight days later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>40 years on, Schoepp celebrates the Pippin and the other classic rides with these six songs that take the listener on six different adventures, each song named for its respective ride (&ldquo;Zippin Pippin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bumper Cars,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Scat&rdquo;). This musical joyride is suitable entertainment for both adults and children. &ldquo;Come mothers, daughters, fathers and sons\/You&rsquo;ll feel a lot better after you&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; Schoepp sings in the first single &ldquo;Bumper Cars,&rdquo; where pop culture rivalries such as Jerry Seinfeld and Newman and the Jedi and Sith collide on the ride.<\/p>\n<p>2019 will see a new release by Schoepp produced by&nbsp;Pat&nbsp;Sansone&nbsp;(Wilco, Autumn Defense).&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoepp &ndash; who&rsquo;s already crisscrossed the the US and EU sharing stages with fellow travelers like&nbsp;The Wallflowers,&nbsp;Jayhawks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Frank Turner&nbsp;&ndash; will be back on the road throughout 2019 in support of the record.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Schoepp will continue his work as a Musical Ambassador for the rare disease research organization, Harmony 4 Hope, as well as Red Wing Shoes and Gibson Guitars.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TrapperSchoepp_12_30_54_AM_4_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 27 - 1:00 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 27","start_time":"1:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/trapperschoepp"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/trapperschoepp.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/trapperschoepp"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rxSMSP-5cRI"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/trapperschoepp\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1FC9UcdlFDyATpXi1IFvLS"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/outlaw-music-festival\/event\/07005661D64579D6"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/19\/2019 02:52:38 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jason-aldean":{"id":"4897","name":"Jason Aldean","friendly_url":"jason-aldean","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want a lay-up. I wanted a slam dunk,&rdquo; says Jason Aldean, discussing his hard-charging and ferociously confident eighth studio album, Rearview Town, out April 13.<\/p>\n<p>His most recent collection, 2016&rsquo;s They Don&rsquo;t Know, bowed at No.1 on the all-genre Billboard 200 albums charts, and Aldean has his sights set for Rearview Town: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been a little bit different than everybody else,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In the early days, with songs like &lsquo;She&rsquo;s Country&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dirt Road Anthem,&rsquo; we were really rolling the dice &mdash; that&rsquo;s how I made my mark, by not being scared to go out and shake things up.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The risks and their rewards electrify the 15 new cuts, snaking between stadium-sized guitar anthems (&ldquo;Dirt to Dust,&rdquo; &ldquo;Up in Smoke&rdquo;), heartfelt country minimalism (&ldquo;Drown the Whiskey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Better At Being Who I Am&rdquo;) and hip-hop swagger (&ldquo;Like You Were Mine&rdquo;).<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, like on the enthusiastically-received lead single, &ldquo;You Make It Easy,&rdquo; currently at No.10 and still climbing on the radio charts, Aldean even finds himself channeling the blues. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare for me to hear a song and get really excited about it,&rdquo; he says of the tune. &ldquo;But this one was immediate.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A native of Macon, Georgia, such grooves are familiar to the star. &ldquo;I was playing all types of music, naturally,&rdquo; he recalls of formative bar gigs. &ldquo;I played Otis Redding. I played the Allman Brothers. I played Stevie Ray Vaughn &mdash; and then I turned around and played Alabama. What&rsquo;s cool about [&ldquo;You Make It Easy&rdquo;] is that it allowed me to show that side of my music and that part of the influence for me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Long a maestro of up-tempo stompers, Aldean kicks Rearview Town off with &ldquo;Dirt to Dust&rdquo; and &ldquo;Set It Off,&rdquo; an epic one-two punch of dirty guitars and undeniable hooks. With razor-sharp production, both songs flat out cook. Speaking about &ldquo;Set It Off,&rdquo; specifically, Aldean says that the quirky bassline has him chomping at the bit to bring the cut out live. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got this really weird beat. You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s about to happen,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;That takes it through the roof.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He heads for traditional country on the standout lost love lament &ldquo;Drowns the Whiskey.&rdquo; Featuring Miranda Lambert, the track is remarkably understated in its arrangement, but it&rsquo;s saturated in well-worn emotions. &ldquo;Miranda is a great singer,&rdquo; Aldean says of the welcome team-up. &ldquo;She does a couple takes and she knocks it out &hellip; I was blown away.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On &ldquo;Better At Being Who I Am&rdquo; Aldean lends a nuanced, knowing delivery to the breakup tale. &ldquo;I think [this] might be the most well-written song that I&rsquo;ve ever recorded,&rdquo; says the singer.<\/p>\n<p>He adds that he found himself attracted to the emotional maturity. &ldquo;At this point, I want to record songs that have some substance to them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are songs that I cut when I was 27 or 28 that I wouldn&rsquo;t cut now. [And] there are songs that I cut now that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for me to cut when I was 27 or 28. I&rsquo;m more conscious of those things these days.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The driving title track strikes a note that&rsquo;s both hopeful and forlorn, a combination that felt particularly familiar to Aldean. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about putting things behind you, things that have held you down, and looking ahead,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When you look at me and my career and a lot of the personal stuff I&rsquo;ve [gone through], it really seemed like a fitting title.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But for all its sonic meanderings, Rearview Town feels indelibly cohesive. Aldean says it&rsquo;s his lifelong love of country &mdash; country music and country life &ndash; that ties it all together. &ldquo;Country is the core of where we&rsquo;re at.&rdquo; That surefootedness has helped define the genre&rsquo;s 21st century. He says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rock-infused country. It&rsquo;s not George Strait&rsquo;s country and it&rsquo;s not Merle Haggard&rsquo;s country, but it is country.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While the album was largely completed prior to Aldean&rsquo;s headlining set at the Route 91 Harvest Festival last fall in Las Vegas, the two-time Entertainer of the Year knows that the tragedy precedes this release as well as the launch of his upcoming tour, the High Noon Neon Tour, kicking off May 10 in Kansas City, Missouri. But after a break that saw the birth of his son, Aldean is more attached to the road than ever.<\/p>\n<p>He says, &ldquo;We all realized that this is what we do. The time off was something we all needed, from me to the band and crew and all of our families; our wives. [But] I love what I do. I&rsquo;ve been doing this since I was 14.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>So when the stage lights go up, they do so on a band with a new perspective. &ldquo;You appreciate every day that you get to play and the guys you get to play it with. You look around and see all of your bandmates and everybody up there with you &mdash; that could have very well not have been the case.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Which may play into why at 19 No.1 country songs, two Entertainer of the Year awards, and more than just a few sold-out stadium shows under his belt, Aldean still has a fire. &ldquo;I never wanted to be a flash in the pan,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;I never wanted to be somebody people forget about five years after I quit playing music. I want people to be jamming to my stuff 20, 30, 40 years from now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With a laugh, he adds, &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ve had 19 No.1&rsquo;s &mdash; that&rsquo;s cool. But 20 sounds a lot cooler. And 30 sounds a lot better than that.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JasonAldean_10_26_51_AM_12_5_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 28 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 28","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jasonaldean"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jasonaldean.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jason_aldean"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCw0F_Xuz0VqemtMAtEfHTdA"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jasonaldean\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3FfvYsEGaIb52QPXhg4DcH"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/jason-aldean\/event\/0700555F91802869"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"01\/11\/2019 10:14:12 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"kane-brown":{"id":"4898","name":"Kane Brown","friendly_url":"kane-brown","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>Kane Brown is soaring on the strength of his full-length, self-titled debut, an RIAA Gold-certified collection that stands as country&rsquo;s best-selling new-artist debut since 2014.&nbsp; Released in December of 2016 and helmed by three-time ACM Producer of the Year Dann Huff and Matthew McVaney,&nbsp;<em>Kane Brown<\/em>&nbsp;debuted at #1 on&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&rsquo;s Top Country Albums and Top 10 on the Billboard 200 all-genre chart with 51,000 units (45,000 in album sales) and would become the #4 best-selling new-artist album debut of 2016, in&nbsp;<em>any<\/em>&nbsp;genre.

The result is Vide Noir: a sonically bold, bravely-executed saga that pushes the band&rsquo;s sound in ambitious new directions.<\/p>\n<p>Singer, songwriter and producer Ben Schneider found inspiration wandering restlessly through his adopted home of Los Angeles at night. His aimless nocturnal journeys ranged all over the city &ndash; across the twinkling grid of the valley; into the creeping shadows of the foothills; through downtown&rsquo;s neon canyons; way out to the darksome ocean. The resulting collection of songs feels like an epic odyssey through the city, across dimensions and out into the cosmos.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Vide Noir&rsquo;s songs were tested on the road as early as 2016 and honed with a jeweler&rsquo;s precision into their final form. Dusty ballads share space on the album with punky rippers, &lsquo;50s sock-hop sways and ethereal electronic passages. Each entry is a glinting star, and together they form a sonic constellation examining the search for meaning amidst the cold indifference of the universe.<\/p>\n<p>Vide Noir was mixed by Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips\/MGMT) and engineered by Sonny DiPerri (Portugal. The Man, Animal Collective). The album honors the traditions of both rock and folk as it embraces modern studio techniques. The stylistic experimentation speaks to Lord Huron&rsquo;s confidence as storytellers and as craftsmen, armed with a growing array of tools.<\/p>\n<p>Lord Huron&rsquo;s work always comes richly adorned, and Vide Noir is no exception. The album will be accompanied by a wealth of imagery, films and immersive experiences crafted to expand upon its narratives and themes. A true multi-media artist, Schneider has previously used videos, a comic book, a choose-your-own-adventure hotline and assorted Easter eggs as means of deepening the listener experience. Fans steely enough to confront the ineffable have already uncovered a few of these accoutrements.<\/p>\n<p>Lord Huron was created by Los Angeles-based Ben Schneider. Born and raised in Michigan, Schneider drew inspiration from the Great Lakes, which were carved by glaciers 14,000 years ago, and his music stands in awe and wonder of the natural world.<\/p>\n<p>After writing and recording two independent EPs (Into the Sun and Mighty) on his own, demand grew for Lord Huron to perform live. Schneider recruited friends Mark Barry (percussion), Miguel Brise&ntilde;o (bass) and Tom Renaud (guitar). Having first played music together at the tender age of 12, the group reunited and quickly hit their stride, transforming the project into a full-fledged band. Lord Huron signed with IAMSOUND, and the label released 2012&rsquo;s Lonesome Dreams, and Strange Trails in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Strange Trails included the song, &ldquo;The Night We Met,&rdquo; which was featured in the Netflix original series &ldquo;13 Reasons Why.&rdquo; The series and song both became hits, and &ldquo;The Night We Met&rdquo; was certified platinum in January of 2018. This year also marks the beginning of a unique alliance between Whispering Pines and Republic Records, who will partner in the release of Vide Noir.<\/p>\n<p>Lord Huron has toured extensively in North America and Europe, earning rave reviews and performing for sold-out crowds at some of the world&rsquo;s most prestigious venues. The band has appeared at a wide range of music festivals including Lollapalooza, Coachella, Bonnaroo and Newport Folk Festival.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LordHuron_3_25_55_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 29 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 29","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lordhuron"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lordhuron\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6ltzsmQQbmdoHHbLZ4ZN25"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lordhuron"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.lordhuron.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC48UiYdP4S_QuKZXSBcwawg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/bon-iver\/event\/0700558602DDB7F3"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 09:31:09 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"julien-baker":{"id":"4905","name":"Julien Baker","friendly_url":"julien-baker","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>Julien Baker&rsquo;s solo debut, Sprained Ankle, was one of the most widely acclaimed works of 2015. The album, recorded by an 18-year-old and her friend in only a few days, was a bleak yet hopeful, intimate document of staggering experiences and grace, centered entirely around Baker&rsquo;s voice, guitar, and unblinking honesty. Sprained Ankle appeared on year-end lists everywhere from NPR Music to The AV Club to New York Magazine&rsquo;s Vulture.<\/p>\n<p>With Turn Out The Lights, the now 21-year-old Baker returns to a much bigger stage, but with the same core of breathtaking vulnerability and resilience. From its opening moments &mdash; when her chiming, evocative melody is accompanied by swells of strings &mdash; Turn Out The Lights throws open the doors to the world without sacrificing the intimacy that has become a hallmark of her songs. The album explores how people live and come to terms with their internal conflict, and the alternately shattering and redemptive ways these struggles play out in relationships. Baker casts an unflinching and accepting eye on the duality of &ndash; and contradictions in &ndash; the human experience, at times even finding humor and joy in the midst of suffering. She ultimately calls on her listeners to move beyond &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; or &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sad,&rdquo; to embrace more complex truths.<\/p>\n<p>The album was recorded at the legendary Ardent Studios in her hometown of Memphis, TN, and mixed by Craig Silvey (The National, Florence &amp; the Machine, Arcade Fire). This evolution from Sprained Ankle&rsquo;s intentionally spare production allowed greater scope and freedom for Baker, who is still the album&rsquo;s sole writer and producer. Strings and woodwinds now shade the corners of her compositions, and Baker takes to piano rather than guitar on several tracks. In songs like the epic &ldquo;Claws In Your Back,&rdquo; these new textures push Baker&rsquo;s work to cinematic heights of intensity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As always, the real draw is her songwriting and lyricism. Turn Out The Lights is more expansive in sound and vision than Sprained Ankle and illustrates significant growth, yet the album retains the haunting delicacy of her heartbreakingly confessional style. Where her debut focused inward on Baker&rsquo;s life and aspects of her identity (female, queer, Christian), Turn Out The Lights reflects on not only her own experiences, but also the experiences of those closest to her. The result finds Baker narrating a deliberate meditation on how we each try to deal with our ever-shifting mental health, and the impact this can have on both ourselves and others. The album sets out to address how the process of coping with internal conflicts affects different relationships &ndash; romantic, familial, and friendly. Baker turns outward to embrace the challenges of the human experience, weaving personal struggles together into one surprisingly hopeful chorus.<\/p>\n<p>The album is bookended by &ldquo;Appointments&rdquo; and &ldquo;Claws in Your Back,&rdquo; two songs that deal with the precarious balance between nihilism and realism. &ldquo;A lot of stuff happened in my life that was rapid change, and it felt like it could not get any worse,&rdquo; Baker says of &ldquo;Appointments.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was like, I have reached critical mass for this amoeba of sadness and it cannot possibly turn out all right. But for the sake of my continuing to exist, I have to believe that it will.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The resulting song (&ldquo;I think if I ruin this, then I know I can live with it,&rdquo; Baker sings) cuts to the core of Baker&rsquo;s uniquely clear-eyed take on human suffering. She resists facile conclusions and never glamorizes the extremes she depicts; yet she continually holds out the possibility of joy and solidarity. On &ldquo;Claws In Your Back,&rdquo; she turns her own hard-won determination to thrive into a rallying cry for her friends (&ldquo;I think I can love the sickness you made. I take it all back, I change my mind. I wanted to stay&rdquo;).<\/p>\n<p>Even as Turn Out The Lights explores broken relationships (&ldquo;Sour Breath&rdquo;), the search for a cure that may not exist (&ldquo;Everything To Help You Sleep&rdquo;), and the impossibility of ever truly understanding each other (&ldquo;Shadowboxing&rdquo;), Baker continually returns to the possibility of joy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in the &lsquo;fixing&rsquo; part, where what healing means is that you no longer get sad or experience grief or have panic attacks,&rdquo; Baker says. &ldquo;Happy is kind of a fleeting and transient emotion. It is not a destination that you can get to by exerting enough mental effort. I believe that joy is something that you can invite into your present circumstance. Whereas happiness seems to be this horizon that&rsquo;s eternally getting further from you, joy is something that you can inhabit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this call to joy even in moments of otherwise total darkness that makes her music a refuge for her fans. Turn Out The Lights is ultimately a healing experience, and it&rsquo;s impossible not to feel Baker&rsquo;s unyielding compassion for the messy and beautiful human experience. &ldquo;When I talk about things in myself I find ugly and unlovable, they are the most effective tools for connecting with other people, for helping other people heal,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And that helps me heal.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JulienBaker_1_02_18_PM_12_10_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 29 - 7:00 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 29","start_time":"7:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/julienrbaker"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/julienrbaker\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/12zbUHbPHL5DGuJtiUfsip"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/julienrbaker"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/julienbaker.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wmGVIvf8Q6s"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/bon-iver\/event\/0700558602DDB7F3"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"02\/12\/2019 09:33:08 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"zac-brown-band":{"id":"5068","name":"Zac Brown Band","friendly_url":"zac-brown-band","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>Zac Brown Band is preparing to release their upcoming new studio album featuring the hit lead single, &ldquo;Someone I Used To Know,&rdquo; currently widely available for streaming and download.

The Los Angeles songstress resembles something of a fairy tale heroine&mdash;albeit one with a Tyler, the Creator obsession, Aurora inspiration, wicked sense of humor, and inimitable fashion sense filtered through a kaleidoscope of hip-hop, grunge, and glam tendencies ready to practically levitate above any runway. It&rsquo;s this kind of je nais sais quoi that fueled the meteoric rise of her debut single &ldquo;ocean eyes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Eilish just scored her first number one album on the Billboard charts with &ldquo;WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?&rdquo; The album follows the success of Eilish&rsquo;s first release &ldquo;dont smile at me,&rdquo; which spent 67 weeks on the Billboard charts. The nine-song set was issued in 2017 and generated more than 1.2 billion on-demand audio streams for its tracks. In 2018, Eilish charted her first five entries on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 songs charts and has notched three more debuts in 2019. In addition, Eilish is the first artist born in the 2000&rsquo;s to have a number one album on the Billboard 200 chart and is the youngest artist to hit number one since 2015. She also contributed a track to the second season of 13 Reasons Why, collaborating with Khalid on the hit single &ldquo;lovely,&rdquo; which charted globally.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BillieEilish_1_20_14_PM_4_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"July 6 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/billieeilish"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wherearetheavocados\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6qqNVTkY8uBg9cP3Jd7DAH"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/billieeilish"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.billieeilish.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/billieeilish"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/event\/07005687B40D2290"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/17\/2019 04:48:19 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"finneas":{"id":"5218","name":"Finneas","friendly_url":"finneas","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>At only 21 years old, the multi-talented Finneas O&rsquo;Connell has already become a buzzing and sought-after producer, songwriter and artist. Working behind the scenes on numerous hit singles, 2018 marked the year that Finneas stepped out into the spotlight with his own innovative and ambitious solo project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in East Los Angeles, Finneas was homeschooled alongside his younger sister, Billie Eilish. Music was always an important part of their childhood and education and by the time he was eleven, his parents had taught him guitar and piano. While he admits that his first foray into playing music was to impress a girl he liked, he quickly found that music itself was, perhaps, his one true love. Finneas took to writing his own songs and by the time he was a teenager, he was already teaching himself to produce.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016 Finneas wrote a song titled &ldquo;Ocean Eyes&rdquo; in his bedroom studio. After playing the song with his band The Slightlys, he realized he had a different vision in mind for the song and asked his sister Billie if she would lend her vocals to the track. Combing her sweet soaring voice with sparse clean production, the brother-sister duo decided to upload the track to Soundcloud. That same single became the breakout hit for Billie Eilish, quickly grabbing her a record deal with Interscope and gaining major media buzz. The siblings continued to write and record together for Billie&rsquo;s solo project, creating her debut EP&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/7fRrTyKvE4Skh93v97gtcU\">don&rsquo;t smile at me<\/a><\/em>&nbsp;and her debut album,&nbsp;<em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?<\/em>&nbsp;which came out on March 29th. Already regarded as a major producer and songwriter to watch, FINNEAS has his own solo project, that he has been quietly fine-tuning in the background -- or, well, in his bedroom studio. If his sold-out headlining gigs at Baby&rsquo;s All Right (NYC) and The Troubadour (LA) or the screaming fans on Billie&rsquo;s tour are anything to go by, the world is very much ready for Finneas (releasing under the capitalized moniker FINNEAS) to put his foot to the pedal with his solo music. Finneas recently finished sold out US and European tours where he did double duty each night, both supporting and playing with Billie Eilish.<\/p>\n<p>With each new release, Finneas consistently proves his talent and versatility as an artist, songwriter and producer. Unafraid to be vulnerable and unfiltered, his songs are rich with pure unadulterated emotion. His poetic lyrics glide over his signature clean, fresh and inventive beats. Utilizing out-of-the-box sounds like handclaps, texting sounds, and matches, as well as cleverly layered harmonies, Finneas&rsquo; music is instantly captivating.<\/p>\n<p>Finneas has also had the opportunity to collaborate with artists including Khalid, Kehlani, Jessie Reyez, Ashe, Olivia O'Brien, Sabrina Claudio, Marian Hill, Bruno Major. His music can also be heard in TV and film including Netflix&rsquo;s hit show 13 Reasons Why, The Vampire Diaries, Pretty Little Liars, Marvel&rsquo;s Runaways, and the movies Everything, Everything and the Oscar-nominated Roma.<\/p>\n<p>With millions of streams, an ever-growing fan base, and press praise trickling in from PAPER, Billboard, Zane Lowe, Ones to Watch, and more, there is no doubt that 2019 will be another momentous year for the multi-talented FINNEAS.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Finneas_1_56_11_PM_4_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"July 6 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FINNEASOFFICIAL"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/Finneas\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/37M5pPGs6V1fchFJSgCguX"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Finneas"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.finneasofficial.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCoYrgNfVXrvzZSM9eVTZVmg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/event\/07005687B40D2290"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/18\/2019 04:05:04 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lil-wayne":{"id":"5159","name":"Lil Wayne","friendly_url":"lil-wayne","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Having sold millions of albums worldwide and garnered four GRAMMY awards, Lil Wayne is one of the most successful and critically lauded artists in Hip-Hop.

Introduced to the world through Dr. Dre's The Chronic, Snoop quickly became one of the most famous stars in rap, partially due to his drawled, laconic rhyming, as well as the realistic violence implied by his lyrics. His 1993 debut effort <strong><em>Doggystyle <\/em><\/strong>became the first debut album to enter the charts at number one.<\/p>\n<p>The solo <strong><em>Da Game Is to Be Sold Not to Be Told<\/em><\/strong>, Snoop's first effort for No Limit, followed in 1998; <strong><em>No Limit Top Dogg<\/em><\/strong> appeared a year later, and <strong><em>Dead Man Walkin'<\/em><\/strong> the year after that. <strong><em>Tha Last Meal<\/em><\/strong> followed in December of that same year. The heavy release schedule resulted in varying musical quality from album to album, but by the turn of the century, Snoop had become such a cultural phenomenon that his albums became almost secondary to the personality behind them. An autobiography appeared in 2001, followed by a stream of movie roles in several high-profile pictures. Late in 2002, Snoop released his first album for Capitol, <strong><em>Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$.<\/em><\/strong> He then switched to Geffen for 2004's <strong><em>R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece<\/em><\/strong>. The hit album spawned Snoop's first number one single, the Pharrell Williams-produced \"<strong>Drop It Like It's Hot<\/strong>,\" as well as the hit \"<strong>Signs<\/strong>\" with Justin Timberlake and Charlie Wilson. <strong><em>R&amp;G<\/em><\/strong> was followed a year later by <strong><em>Welcome to tha Chuuch: Da Album<\/em><\/strong>, a collection of tracks from the Welcome to the Chuuch mixtape series.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, he appeared on Tha Dogg Pound's Active and Ice Cube's Laugh Now, Cry Later. Toward the end of that year, the intentionally leaked \"My Peoples\" freestyle appeared. The track paid tribute to many of those involved in Cali's Latin rap community, so it was no big surprise when \"<strong><em>Vato,<\/em><\/strong>\" with Cypress Hill's B Real, became his next album's leadoff single. The hard and very G-funk <strong><em>Tha Blue Carpet Treatment<\/em><\/strong> triumphantly capped off a year of heavy West Coast activity. In 2009, he issued <strong><em>Malice N Wonderland<\/em><\/strong>, the maiden release of a new alliance with the reactivated Priority label, which also signed him on as its creative chairman. A year later, the CD\/DVD set <strong><em>More Malice<\/em><\/strong> rounded up some odds and ends from the album and packaged them with a DVD featuring the Malice N Wonderland short film. He maintained his mainstream image with a star appearance on Katy Perry's \"California Gurls,\" nabbing Snoop his third number one on the Billboard Hot 100.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, he released <strong><em>Doggumentary<\/em><\/strong>, an album he considered the sequel to his classic debut. Also arriving that same year was a feature film with Khalifa, <strong><em>Mac and Devin Go to High School<\/em><\/strong>, along with its accompanying soundtrack. After a 2012 trip to Jamaica, Snoop Dogg returned rechristened as Snoop Lion, and with the help of producer Diplo, he released his first all-reggae album, <strong><em>Reincarnated<\/em><\/strong>&rdquo; on RCA in 2013. Another name change came later in the year when he became Snoopzilla and joined modern funkster D&acirc;m-Funk for the project\/album <strong><em>7 Days of Funk<\/em><\/strong>. A return to Snoop Dogg came in 2015 when he partnered with Pharrell Williams for the hip-hop effort <strong><em>Bush<\/em><\/strong>. The album included the single \"Peaches N Cream\" and featured guest appearances from Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake, Robin Thicke, and Charlie Wilson. <strong><em>Coolaid<\/em><\/strong>, a back-to-basics effort for which Swizz Beatz served as executive producer, was released in 2016. That same year, Snoop teamed up with Martha Stewart for VH1's Martha &amp; Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, a variety show that featured bits with guest actors and performances by hip-hop musical guests. For his 16th set, Snoop once again changed course, this time dipping into the gospel world for 2018's <strong><em>Snoop Dogg Presents Bible of Love<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SnoopDogg_2_56_20_PM_4_5_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"July 7 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"July 7","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/snoopdogg"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/snoopdogg\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SnoopDogg"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/snoopdogg.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/westfesttv"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/lil-wayne\/event\/07005682D3018270"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/18\/2019 02:09:47 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"schoolboy-q":{"id":"5113","name":"ScHoolboy Q","friendly_url":"schoolboy-q","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Mixing bud smokers' anthems with socially conscious numbers, rapper ScHoolboy Q spent three years in the mixtape underground before launching his career properly in 2011. The first mixtape, the autobiographical Schoolboy Turned Hustla, landed in 2008 and quickly caught the attention of Kendrick Lamar and Top Dawg Entertainment. Lamar would form the Black Hippy collective with ScHoolboy along with Jay Rock and Ab-Soul, and the Top Dawg label would sign the artist. His Gangster &amp; Soul mixtape landed in 2009, and Top Dawg released his official debut, Setbacks, in 2011.In 2012, Top Dawg announced they had signed a joint venture deal with Interscope and Aftermath, which saw Lamar's debut album get a full release. Later that year, ScHoolboy Q announced he was recording his third album and would be the second member of Black Hippy to benefit from the deal. After a series of mysterious tweets in 2013, Q announced that the release would be called Oxymoron, but nearly a year passed before the dark and abstract album -- which featured a whole host of guest producers and vocalists -- was released in February 2014. Nevertheless, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and pushed the single \"Studio\" into the Top 40. A worldwide tour took up most of 2015, and 2016 saw the \"That Part\" single drop as a preview of that year's album, Blank Face LP, which debuted at number two. In 2017, he appeared on the Calvin Harris collaborative track \"Cash Out\" with PartyNextDoor and DRAM, as well as on \"Bahamas\" with A$AP Mob and \"Lil Story\" with Gucci Mane. In 2018, he linked up with 2 Chainz and Saudi for the track \"X\" from the TDE-curated Black Panther soundtrack.

Pianist Kenny Hensley learned to fly planes and enrolled in kung-fu training in China, while bassist Chris Zasche packed up a camper and went off the grid in the Canadian Rockies. Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist\/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.<br \/><br \/>After his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist\/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"<br \/><br \/>When they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"<br \/><br \/>That renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros. Records. \"This album isn't about us now having achieved our dreams,\" says Thielen. \"The day we started being able to live off our art was the day we achieved our dreams, in my mind. This is the album where we really fell into our true voices as those artists.\"<br \/><br \/>Recorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Cage The Elephant), Signs Of Light, crackles with the upbeat, sing-a-long energy of the Head And The Heart's finest work. Lead single \"All We Ever Knew,\" which was written during the \"Let's Be Still\" era but never captured to the band's satisfaction until now, is sure to be a crowd-pleaser, while \"Turn It Around\" seems primed to be a future concert staple, matching its inspirational message with a lush and multi-layered soundscape.<br \/><br \/>Throughout, the colors are brighter, the electric guitars are louder and the musical touchstones more universal. The propulsive, smile-inducing ode to Los Angeles \"City Of Angels\" and the head-nodding \"Rhythm &amp; Blues\" nod to classic Fleetwood Mac, while the organ-flecked \"Dreamer\" is a timeless-sounding ballad that could have been beamed straight out of an old jukebox.<br \/><br \/>\"Jay was really adamant about getting a great performance,\" group member Jonathan Russell says. \"We have all the tools in the world to make something sound real or more excitable, but it's never really as true as the band in the room for the whole take. 'City Of Angels' - we had previously re-cut that song and played it so many times. But within two takes in Nashville, we nailed it. It felt like we were playing on a massive stage in front of tons of people.\"<br \/><br \/>Elsewhere, Thielen's \"Library Magic\" could almost be seen as a letter to the other five members, acknowledging the ups-and-downs of life in a successful band while celebrating the unique and constantly evolving bond between them. \"I wrote that song after having our first real time off as a band,\" she says. \"It touches on the storied relationships between band members trying to survive living in a van off of accelerated time and gas station crafts for years straight, but it also applies to any of life's relationships.\"<br \/><br \/>The Head And The Heart's 2011 self-titled debut album captured a nascent but undeniable creative partnership between six strangers thrown together by little more than a shared love of music. It became one of Sub Pop Records' best-selling debut releases ever, and rocketed the band to acclaim well beyond its then-home base in Seattle. The formative experiences that followed both on and off the stage heavily informed the 2013 follow-up \"Let's Be Still,\" which continues to remind Russell of \"the stale beer, bleach and potato chips from all the venues we saw once this became our livelihood.\"<br \/><br \/>On Signs Of Light, that gamut of emotions is felt most deeply on the Josiah Johnson-penned title track, which none of the other members had ever heard until they happened to walk in on him playing it over and over at the piano during pre-production in El Paso, Texas. \"It was one of those moments where no one talks,\" Russell remembers. \"No one needs the chords; no one is looking up. You simply pick up your instrument and play. The next thing you know, nearly 10 minutes have gone by and you have no idea how or why or what just happened.\"<\/span><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_HeadandtheHeartThe_8_27_48_AM_3_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 10:15 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theheadandtheheart\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.theheadandtheheart.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/headandtheheart"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H2hkZbVsrPY&list=PLrX1HbjrlIioz29eaeR92pFyopSlBD9w1"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/theheadandtheheart\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0n94vC3S9c3mb2HyNAOcjg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/03\/2019 02:31:04 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-lonely-island":{"id":"4971","name":"The Lonely Island","friendly_url":"the-lonely-island","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>Friends since childhood from Berkeley, California, The Lonely Island coined their name from the cramped West Coast apartment they shared as comic start-ups. They became a mainstay of the L.A. short-comedy film culture launched by Channel 101, a constantly evolving webisode\/film contest where attendees could vote for their favorite five-minute comedy video, and whose alumnus includes Jack Black, Drew Carey, Sarah Silverman and even FlavorFlav. Their willingness to embrace the digital possibilities of comedy was christened by the launch of their own website in 2001, thelonelyisland.com, which was very much in sync with a growing internet fan base that eagerly followed their online antics. The triumvirate&rsquo;s breakout skits and experimental embeds would eventually snag them pilot deals with more established comedy holding companies like Comedy Central and Fox, as well as a plumb writing gig for the MTV Movie Awards that would lead to a successful audition with Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels.<\/p>\n<p>Their 2009 debut album, &ldquo;Incredibad,&rdquo; included Emmy&reg; winning sensation \"D*** In A Box,\" featuring superstar Justin Timberlake. The album also featured the follow-up gold records \"J**z In My Pants\" and \"Like a Boss\" which have over 230 million views combined on YouTube. The Grammy&reg; nominated third single &ldquo;I&rsquo;m On A Boat&rdquo; (feat. T-Pain) went platinum and catapulted the album into over 457,000 copies sold making it the #1 selling comedy album in 2009 and 2010. The trio established themselves with the enormously popular series of corresponding Digital Shorts for their singles, which were frequently featured on Saturday Night Live beginning with the debut of the pop culture sensation &ldquo;Lazy Sunday&rdquo; in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>Their 2011 album &ldquo;Turtleneck &amp; Chain,&rdquo; which debuted at #3 on Billboard, was nominated for a Grammy&reg; in the category of &ldquo;Best Comedy Album&rdquo; and featured such talents as Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, Santigold, and Beck. The album&rsquo;s first smash single, &ldquo;I Just Had Sex&rdquo; (feat. Akon), was certified platinum and has 297 millions views on YouTube. The second single, &ldquo;The Creep&rdquo; (feat. Nicki Minaj and John Waters) has over 105 million YouTube views. Additional singles, &ldquo;Jack Sparrow&rdquo; (feat. Michael Bolton), has 193 million views and &ldquo;Threw It On The Ground&rdquo; has 102 million views on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>In June 2013, the group released their third studio effort on Republic Records, &ldquo;The Wack Album&rdquo;. The album includes songs featuring Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Robyn, Adam Levine, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Too $hort, Pharrell Williams, T-Pain, Billie Joe Armstrong, and Solange. The Wack Album&rsquo;s lead single, &ldquo;YOLO&rdquo; (feat. Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar), made YouTube&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top 10 Trending Videos&rdquo; for 2013.

But in September 2014, two months before the band headlined the 20,000-seat O2 Arena in London, Aaron passed along the first set of musical sketches to Matt. &ldquo;We really didn&rsquo;t take much of a break,&rdquo; says Matt. &ldquo;We started working on this record the minute we finished touring the last one. The only break we took was from the constant pressure we put on each other.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t feel like rushing it,&rdquo; says Aaron, who produced Sleep Well Beast. &ldquo;People thought the National went away, but we were just working on ideas.&rdquo; With members now living in five different cities, the band made an extra effort to get together in the same room &ndash; sometimes in studios in upstate New York, or out in Los Angeles. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always worked on demos together,&rdquo; explains Bryce. &ldquo;But this time we were actually in the same physical space doing it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When we all lived in Brooklyn we rarely did these kinds of week-long sessions&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;This time we got together for long stretches, just to mess around and experiment without deadlines or distractions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In February 2015, Aaron and Bryce convened for a series of writing sessions in an old church in Hudson, New York. Then, in the spring of 2016, Aaron completed work on his own residential studio, Long Pond,in upstate New York, where most of the album was recorded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time we have had a space of our own where we can keep all our instruments and work on songs any time, day or night,&rdquo; says Bryce. Aaron adds, &ldquo;The space was designed specifically for the band to make this album, with an open plan and no control room so that everyone could be wired up and playing all the time. The idea was to loosen the reigns and formality of our past recording process and allow for experimentation from beginning to end.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Bryan describes it, &ldquo;Getting drum sounds in a previously untested room was a seriously fun exercise in trial-and-error learning, in a group setting. Time disappeared, the sun set, and then the massive frog population in Aaron&rsquo;s pond started singing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While the studio served as the home base, the band also sought outside collaboration. As part of a weekend residency at Funkhaus in Berlin, Bryce and Aaron invited guests to plug in and play along with instrumental tracks from the National&rsquo;s work-in-progress. Bryce says, &ldquo;We spent a week in East Berlin in this beautiful 1950&rsquo;s communist-era recording studio with tons of musicians from very different backgrounds, just letting them listen and react to the music we&rsquo;d been cooking for so many months within the band.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was a very interesting way to collect new sounds and process existing ones,&rdquo; says Aaron. Late in the process the band convened an orchestra in Paris to record Bryce&rsquo;s orchestrations for the songs before returning to Long Pond to mix the album.<\/p>\n<p>There are songs on Sleep Well Beast that are instantly recognizable as the National, but others are much harder to classify. The lyrics are about &ldquo;trying to come clean about the things you&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; says Matt. &ldquo;Some of it&rsquo;s about marriage, some of it&rsquo;s about my relationship with Aaron and the band, some of it&rsquo;s about train tracks and dancing.&rdquo; Guitar solos appear like never before, yet on some songs guitars account for only a tiny fraction of the music. &ldquo;It was important that we genuinely explore new territory and risk falling on our faces, or not make a record at all,&rdquo; explains Aaron. &ldquo;This album feels complete to me.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TheNational_8_54_38_AM_5_23_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thenationalofficial"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thenational\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheNational"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/americanmary.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/thenational"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 09:25:18 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"steve-aoki":{"id":"4906","name":"Steve Aoki","friendly_url":"steve-aoki","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<p><strong>Catch Steve Aoki at the Dim Mak Takeover of the Miller Lite Oasis Stage on Wednesday, June 26th. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The two-time Grammy-nominated producer\/DJ, is one of today&rsquo;s most successful American cross - genre artists, collectively counting 1.5 billion music streams on Spotify, with an additional 2 billion music streams onYouTube.

And Chicago is the first American rock band to chart Top 40 albums in six consecutive decades.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago was inducted into the 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! This was their first nomination. They&rsquo;ve been eligible since 1994. A long time coming!<\/p>\n<p>Chicago's first album, <em>Chicago Transit Authority<\/em>, was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame in 2014, and the band performed on the Grammy stage for the first time that year.<\/p>\n<p>Robert Lamm and James Pankow have become the latest inductees of the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2017. These legendary songwriters wrote mega-hits such as, \"25 or 6 to 4,\" \"Saturday In The Park,\" \"Feelin' Stronger Every Day,\" \"Make Me Smile,\" and many others.<\/p>\n<p>More than 40 years after its debut, <em>Chicago II <\/em>still sounds like nothing else. Released in 1970, Chicago&rsquo;s second album brims with confidence and inspiration as it draws on everything from orchestral music to heavy rock. It spawned a trio of Top Ten hits, and the timeless classic has been remastered to reveal unprecedented clarity and definition. For the first time a new stereo remix, created by British musician and producer Steven Wilson from the 16-track multi-track tapes, made it possible to bring out elements that were muffled or submerged in the mix. The result is a new stereo version of CHICAGO II that boasts clearness, punch and definition that it didn&rsquo;t have before. It has recently been released by Rhino Records on CD and vinyl.<\/p>\n<p>CHICAGO&rsquo;s award-winning documentary film, <em>Now More Than Ever: The History Of Chicago<\/em> premiered on CNN on New Year&rsquo;s Day and ranked No. 1 among adults 25-54. This is per &ldquo;Nielsen Fast National Time Period Based Data&rdquo; for 1\/1\/17 from 8 PM -10 PM. The documentary film was originally shown at the Sedona International Film Festival in February, 2016, and won the Film Festival&rsquo;s Best of Fest Audience Choice Award. The band opened the festival with back-to-back sold-out performances.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, <em>Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago <\/em>won three awards in April, 2016, at the 10th Annual Fort Myers Beach Film Festival, taking home top prizes in the Documentary and Audience Award categories. Director Peter Pardini was awarded the festival&rsquo;s Rising Star Award in direction and was on hand to accept all three awards.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier that month the documentary was the runner-up for Audience Award at the Sarasota Film Festival.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago&rsquo;s newest record of new studio tracks, <em>&ldquo;NOW&rdquo;<\/em> <em>CHICAGO XXXVI<\/em>, was released on Frontiers Records. It includes eleven brand new songs, recorded on the road. Chicago has built a new recording system that is flexible, portable, powerful and musical. This new &ldquo;recording rig&rdquo; travels with the band. They have even created an online collaboration portal that allows even more performances to be worked on around the clock from remote locations. The CD package is a six-panel digipack with a beautiful 16-page full color lyric booklet.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago&rsquo;s lifetime achievements include two Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, Founding Artists of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a Chicago street dedicated in their honor, and keys to and proclamations from an impressive list of US cities. Record sales top the 100,000,000 mark, and include 21 Top 10 singles, 5 consecutive Number One albums, 11 Number One singles and 5 Gold singles. An incredible 25 of their 36 albums have been certified platinum, and the band has a total of 47 gold and platinum awards.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago have toured every year since the beginning - they&rsquo;ve never missed a year. The original four band members are Robert Lamm on keyboards and vocals, Lee Loughnane on trumpet and vocals, James Pankow on trombone and Walt Parazaider on woodwinds. The band line-up also includes Wally Reyes, Jr. on drums, Keith Howland on guitar and vocals, Lou Pardini on keyboards and vocals, Ray Herrmann on sax and flute, Neil Donell on vocals, Brett Simons on bass and Ramon \"Ray\" Yslas on percussion.<\/p>\n<p>For five years, Chicago raised over a quarter of a million dollars to fight breast cancer for the American Cancer Society by having a winning bidder come on stage and sing &ldquo;If You Leave Me Now&rdquo; in concert. Chicago generously support other charitable causes, donating a portion of ticket sales to Kelly Cares, established by Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly and his wife Paqui, to support local, national and global organizations that strive to improve their communities in the areas of health and education. Portions of ticket sales also benefit the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation, which seeks a cure for a fatal children&rsquo;s disease, Niemann-Pick Type C. Chicago manager Peter Schivarelli, who played football for Coach Parseghian, is on Notre Dame&rsquo;s Board Of Directors for their Athletic Commission. Chicago has also associated with Hannah &amp; Friends, an organization that serves children and adults with special needs. Hannah &amp; Friends is the personal mission of Maura Weis and her husband, Charlie Weis, the former coach at the University of Kansas.<\/p>\n<p>From the signature sound of the Chicago horns, their iconic Vocalists, and a few dozen of ever-Classic Songs, this band&rsquo;s concerts are celebrations. 2019 marks the band&rsquo;s 52nd consecutive year of touring, without missing a single concert date!<\/p>\n<p>Chicago continue to be true ambassadors for their beloved hometown, carrying the city's name with pride and dignity around the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Chicago_1_39_27_PM_1_18_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 29 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 29","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Chicago.Official\/"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/chicagotheband.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chicagotheband"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cG2Bclwvd3c&feature=youtu.be"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chicagotheband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3iDD7bnsjL9J4fO298r0L0"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/03\/2019 01:31:39 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jason-mraz":{"id":"5035","name":"Jason Mraz","friendly_url":"jason-mraz","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p><strong>Jason Mraz<\/strong>&nbsp;has quietly amassed a diverse fan base throughout all parts of the globe.

The track also broke the record for consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart at the time. \"Shut Up and Dance\" racked up over six million downloads and 850 million streams in the process leading to a slew of honors including winning two Billboard Music Awards, a nomination for an MTV Music Video Award for Best Rock Video, American Music Award nominations for Favorite Pop\/Rock Duo Or Group, New Artist of the Year, and Favorite Alternative Rock Artist. They were also nominated for an iHeart Radio Music Award for Best Duo\/Group of the Year, Song of the Year, and Alternative Rock Song of the Year for \"Shut Up and Dance.\" WALK THE MOON has been praised by music industry tastemakers across the board since their explosive first single \"Anna Sun\" was released in 2012, as Interview Magazine proclaimed, \"There's something about WALK THE MOON that's absolutely out of this world.

On this new release, the band explores their expansive musicianship with boldly eclectic arrangements anchored by a keen melodic presence.<\/p>\n<p>To direct the band&rsquo;s continued evolution, they collaborated with producer Alex Salibian (Elle King, Mikky Ekko) and Executive Producer Jeff Bhaskar, 2016 Grammy winner for Producer of the Year. Thematically, Home Of The Strange builds from the opening track &ldquo;Amerika&rdquo;, a song inspired by Franz Kafka's posthumously published and unfinished novel of the same name. The poignant message and bold sonics on Home of the Strange have been met with critical acclaim, leading to an NPR interview expanding upon the immigrant experience and Rolling Stone referencing &ldquo;a new-wave sheen that flatters (the band).&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Young the Giant first broke through with their 2010 self-titled debut album, which featured the RIAA-gold certified hits, \"My Body\" and \"Cough Syrup.\" This was followed by the release of 2014&rsquo;s Mind Over Matter, which was both a commercial and critical success and prompted The New York Times to call lead singer Sameer Gadhia &ldquo;one of the great contemporary rock voices.&rdquo; Since then, the band has toured the world, with their most recent route featuring sold out performances at Radio City Music Hall, The Greek Theatre, and Aragon Ballroom. They have become a festival mainstay at high profile outings such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, and Governor's Ball among others.

The Beatles were justifiably #1, but Foreigner came in ahead of Britney Spears, Bob Dylan, Phil Collins, Prince, Queen, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard.<\/p>\n<p>With ten multi-platinum albums and sixteen Top 30 hits, Foreigner is universally hailed as one of the most popular rock acts in the world with a formidable musical arsenal that continues to propel sold-out tours and album sales, now exceeding 75 million.<\/p>\n<p>Responsible for some of rock and roll's most enduring anthems including Juke Box Hero, Cold As Ice, Hot Blooded, Waiting For A Girl Like You, Feels Like The First Time, Urgent, Head Games, Say You Will, Dirty White Boy, Long, Long Way From Home and the worldwide #1 hit, I Want To Know What Love Is, Foreigner continues to rock the charts more than 40 years into the game with massive airplay and continued Billboard Top 200 album success. Foreigner also features strongly in every category in Billboard's Greatest of All Time listing. Catalog sales often eclipse those of Led Zeppelin, AC\/DC, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Def Leppard, Van Halen, Aerosmith and most of their Classic Rock peers. (Source: Nielsen SoundScan week ending 8\/3\/17).<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1976, Foreigner's debut album produced the hits \"Feels Like The First Time,\" \"Cold As Ice\" and \"Long, Long Way From Home.\" The album Double Vision followed, as did a string of hits like \"Urgent,\" \"Juke Box Hero\" and \"Waiting For A Girl Like You.\" Those songs helped give Foreigner's next album, 4, its impressive run at #1 on the Billboard chart. At the zenith of 80's sound, Foreigner's fifth album, Agent Provocateur, gave the world the incredible #1 global hit,\" I Want To Know What Love Is.\" This musical milestone followed the record-breaking song \"Waiting For A Girl Like You.\"<\/p>\n<p>At Foreigner's core is the founder and Songwriters Hall of Fame member Mick Jones, the visionary maestro whose stylistic songwriting, indelible guitar hooks and multi-layered talents continue to escalate Foreigner's influence and guide the band to new horizons. He reformed the band after a 2002 hiatus and selected lead singer Kelly Hansen to help write an inspired new chapter in the history of Foreigner. One of rock's greatest showmen, Hansen is known for his innate ability to connect with the crowds. As a front man and lead vocalist, Hansen is among the most respected, consummate professionals in rock and roll. With a 35-year career that spans almost every area of music, from the role of lead vocalist to producing and engineering, Kelly has the unique ability to advance and excel when faced with new challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Mick also brought in bassist Jeff Pilson, multi-instrumentalist Tom Gimbel, guitarist Bruce Watson, Michael Bluestein on keyboards, and Chris Frazier on drums. An unprecedented new level of energy lead the group to a re-emergence of astounding music that speaks to long time Foreigner fans and younger generations. With renewed vitality and direction, Foreigner hit the Billboard charts again with the 2005 release of their live greatest hits album, Extended Versions. Can't Slow Down followed in 2009 and entered the Billboard chart in the Top 30, driven by two Top 20 radio singles, \"In Pieces\" and \"When It Comes To Love.\" To follow was the release of the band's 3-disc set, Feels Like The First Time, which included an acoustic CD with an intimate and unique re-interpretation of many Foreigner classics, studio re-records by the new lineup and a live performance DVD showcasing the group's exceptional live energy.<\/p>\n<p>Foreigner experienced another surge in popularity when several of their hits were featured on the Rock of Ages soundtrack, including \"I Want To Know What Love Is,\" \"Juke Box Hero\" and \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" -- more songs than any other one band on the soundtrack. Hollywood quickly took note, and several more tracks were featured in hit films \"Anchorman 2,\" \"Magic Mike\" and \"Pitch Perfect,\" sending Foreigner downloads up 400%. The video game industry was soon to follow with the blockbuster release, \"Grand Theft Auto V.\"<\/p>\n<p>Downloads continued to soar after their worldwide #1 hit \"I Want To Know What Love Is\" was featured as the 2015 season finale end title of \"Orange Is The New Black.\" Foreigner hits have also recently been included in such primetime TV shows as \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\" among others. Hot Blooded is on the trailer for the Angry Birds movie and has been streamed more than 6 million times. The high visibility of Foreigner's songs continues to introduce the band's music to a whole future generation of fans, exemplified by Jack Black's version of \"Juke Box Hero\" in Kung Fu Panda 3. \"I Want To Know What Love Is\" featured in the summer 2017 box-office #1 \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" and \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" is featured in Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"<\/p>\n<p>In June 2013, Mick Jones was inducted to the Songwriters Hall Of Fame. A multi-talented and multi-dimensional \"musician's musician,\" Jones has also written songs such as \"Bad Love\" with Eric Clapton and \"Dreamer\" with Ozzy Osbourne, and produced records for others including Billy Joel's Storm Front and Van Halen's 5150. A Grammy and Golden Globe-nominated songwriter, Jones is the winner of the prestigious British Ivor Novello Songwriter Award for \"The Flame Still Burns,\" the soundtrack music for the film Still Crazy.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2014, Atlantic Records Chairman Craig Kallman presented Mick Jones with RIAA gold and platinum digital awards for six Foreigner songs. These awards signify 500,000 and 1,000,000 downloads of Foreigner hits. That is more individual awards than any other heritage rock band, and an illustration of Foreigner's resonance in the digital era.<\/p>\n<p>The year continued with Foreigner's headline run in The Soundtrack of Summer US amphitheater tour. The hits compilation album of the same name was released to coincide with the tour and immediately hit the Billboard Top 200 chart, peaking at #64. For most weeks during the tour, Juke Box Heroes joined The Soundtrack Of Summer in the Billboard Top 200 making Foreigner the only Classic Rock band to have such a remarkable presence in today's chart.<\/p>\n<p>Foreigner made headlines again in the summer of 2015 while gaining legions of new fans by joining mega act Kid Rock on his \"Cheap Date: First Kiss Tour,\" rocking amphitheatres and stadiums across the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Foreigner kicked off 2016 with a much hailed unplugged appearance on The Today Show on February 11th followed by a short run of New York area sold out acoustic shows culminating with an epic concert at The Lincoln Center as part of the acclaimed American Songbook Series. These appearances coincided with the release of Foreigner's first ever live acoustic album In Concert: Unplugged. The band's royalties are donated to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and the album is available exclusively via Amazon. Foreigner recorded this unique acoustic album at a once-in-a-lifetime private concert hosted by Edsel B. Ford II on August 24, 2015 at the Ford Motor Company Conference &amp; Event Center in Detroit, MI. In October 2016, Foreigner performed for the very first time at New York's iconic Carnegie Hall with a sold out acoustic show. The show highlighted the band's ongoing relationship with the GRAMMY Museum's initiative to promote music education in our nation's schools. It included an a cappella contest among New York high schools who competed for a $5,000 prize donated by the band.<\/p>\n<p>2017 marked the celebration of Foreigner's 40th anniversary. It commenced with a European tour that included Foreigner performing orchestral versions of the hits with the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra in Lucerne, Switzerland. The Warner Music Group released a double CD set '40,' which includes 40 songs recorded between 1977 and 2017. The album features two tracks recorded especially for this release, 'Give My Life For Love' and a new version of 'I Don't Want To Live Without You.' The album spent nine weeks in the Billboard Top 200 chart. The US anniversary headline tour played 40 shows across the United States where the band was supported by Cheap Trick and Jason Bonham's Led Zeppelin Experience.<\/p>\n<p>Foreigner is one of the most viewed YouTube artists with anywhere between 700,000 and 900,000 weekly viewings of their songs (Source: Next Big Sound).<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Foreigner_5_10_26_PM_5_17_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 26 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 26","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foreigner"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ForeignerMusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ForeignerVEVO"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/foreignerlive\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6IRouO5mvvfcyxtPDKMYFN"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.foreigneronline.com\/welcome"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/17\/2019 05:12:25 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"third-eye-blind":{"id":"5040","name":"Third Eye Blind","friendly_url":"third-eye-blind","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>Since 1997, San Francisco's Third Eye Blind have recorded four best-selling albums and assembled one career retrospective. 3EB will release 'Dopamine', their first studio collection in six years, in Spring 2015. Led by Stephan Jenkins, 3EB won wide success during a tumultuous group of years when the major-label recording industry was finally losing its grip on an enterprise that for decades it had dominated with steely efficiency. Nothing could have made 3EB happier! 3EB, however, have experienced no comparable loss. Instead, they have gained artistic clarification -- and, surprisingly, a fan base who is larger, younger and more dedicated than ever. Participation in the older, untouchable realm of nervous star-making could color a band's identity. In the case of 3EB, it often blurred the perception of their brilliant musical creations. In recent years, those creations have recast the band among a current generation of fans. 3EB now write, tour, record, and communicate in a fluid new world where their music continues naturally to evolve. Their exchange with their audience is unfiltered and being from the hub of tech, they are using it to develop a closer exchange with their audience.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ThirdEyeBlind_9_21_48_AM_3_11_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 29 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 29","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ThirdEyeBlind\/"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.thirdeyeblind.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thirdeyeblind"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thirdeyeblind\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6TcnmlCSxihzWOQJ8k0rNS"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thirdeyeblind"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/19\/2019 04:38:09 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jimmy-eat-world":{"id":"4977","name":"Jimmy Eat World","friendly_url":"jimmy-eat-world","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>Before Jimmy Eat World entered the studio to record their ninth full-length album, <em>Integrity Blues<\/em> [RCA], the members of the multiplatinum Mesa, AZ rock band did something they&rsquo;ve never done in over two decades.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We took a little break,&rdquo; smiles lead singer and guitarist Jim Adkins.<\/p>\n<p>After a successful 10<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary tour revisiting <em>Futures<\/em>, the musicians briefly went their separate ways at the end of 2014. Adkins released a series of 7&rdquo; &amp; embarked on his first worldwide solo tour, Lind released an EP and toured with his wife in The Wretched Desert, Linton took up boxing, and Burch opened up CaskWerks Distillery in Arizona.<\/p>\n<p>When the band reconvened in November 2015, they teamed up with producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen [Paramore, M83] and began sifting through ideas.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I came to a realization,&rdquo; admits Adkins. &ldquo;In the break, writing was a little trickier. I wanted to change things up. So, instead of writing about a problem, I wanted to write about a solution. If you look at your life for what&rsquo;s going wrong, it won&rsquo;t be too hard to find things. If you start looking at what you have rather than what you&rsquo;re missing out on, you come away from things with a much different perspective that&rsquo;s a lot more grateful and positive. As an album, <em>Integrity Blues<\/em> is about trying to overcome that personal struggle instead of getting upset with what life could be that it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They recorded in Los Angeles with Meldal-Johnsen, offering a different setting from their usual Arizona digs.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We became willing to throw away our default responses to everything and search for the best answers rather than relying on what was familiar or comfortable. When you&rsquo;re younger and you make music, you do it for discovery. Being in this for a long time, it&rsquo;s about throwing out all of your expectations and comforts and seeing what you can do without them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With warm production and a powerful upbeat groove, <em>Integrity Blues<\/em> first single &ldquo;Sure and Certain&rdquo; pairs a buzzing guitar hum with an unshakable chant.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the idea of having blinders on for what you want to do and achieve,&rdquo; the frontman explains. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so laser focused on what you think you want, you&rsquo;re missing out on everything around you. It can be a very limiting way to go about life.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the gorgeously minimal title track &ldquo;Integrity Blues&rdquo; tempers orchestral, cinematic overtones with a stark and striking vocal performance.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a song I wrote on the solo tour,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;Sometimes, the idea of walking your path the best you can feels like lonely work. The only way out is action. Feelings of being in a dark place are actually growth opportunities. It&rsquo;s emotional jiu-jitsu to shift your perspective into seeing it that way.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the record, &ldquo;Get Right&rdquo; snaps into an energetic refrain, while &ldquo;Through&rdquo; serves up one of the band&rsquo;s hookiest moments to date.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;You Are Free&rdquo; flaunts one of the group&rsquo;s most hummable and heartfelt refrains, serving as another high watermark. &ldquo;It Matters&rdquo; illuminates the band&rsquo;s diverse sonic palette and covers what Adkins describes as &ldquo;a central theme about the idea that a sense of comfort comes from within and not just external validation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pass The Baby&rdquo; builds from a delicate heartbeat-style click into a deliberate and distorted explosion. Near seven-minute closer &ldquo;Pol Roger&rdquo; carves out an emotional and entrancing climax encased in a rapture of guitars and vocals, which according to Adkins, &ldquo;Felt like the right way to sum everything up.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Surveying the journey thus far, Adkins maintains the same passion he did on day one, and it continues to fuel Jimmy Eat World. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to play music since second grade, and here I am playing music. It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re immensely grateful for. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t take it lightly. We want to be in a constant state of progress. You have to move forward in a way that&rsquo;s challenging and evolving.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, you have to be proud of your own work,&rdquo; he leaves off. &ldquo;We are. If you breathe that in and believe it, you&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JimmyEatWorld_8_57_33_AM_3_11_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jimmyeatworld\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jimmyeatworld.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jimmyeatworld"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FIhxSnAHFeA"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jimmyeatworld\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3Ayl7mCk0nScecqOzvNp6s"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/16\/2019 03:12:05 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lizzo":{"id":"4969","name":"Lizzo","friendly_url":"lizzo","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p><p>Lizzo has arrived. <\/p><p>In 2014's hip-hop culture, built on stale rhymes about sex, money and drugs, Houston-bred, Minneapolis-based artist, Lizzo relies on inventive wordplay and an ability to seamlessly flow between rapping and singing to set her above the rest.

Lauren Mayberry, Iain Cook, and Martin Doherty certainly fit this bill. They unabashedly adore music of the wind-in-your-hair variety. And, of course, they play in a band, the Scottish synth pop group, CHVRCHES.<\/p>\n<p>And yet &hellip; Since emerging in 2013 with the glistening brightness of their breakthrough single, &ldquo;Recover,&rdquo; CHVRCHES have always projected an insularity, a subtle but unmistakable wariness about leaning into their obvious Hit Song of the Summer-writing potential. At their core, CHVRCHES are true blue Glaswegian punks. They&rsquo;ve wanted to protect themselves, and protect that undercurrent of melancholy that gives depth to their sunniness.<\/p>\n<p>To this end, the band members have always kept their creative process close and tight. They&rsquo;ve been diligent to the max about managing the way their band is portrayed. And, of course, they have historically produced every piece of music themselves, including their 2013 debut, The Bones of What You Believe, and 2015 follow-up, Every Open Eye. &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; was their go-to response, Martin recalls laughing, when asked to consider collaboration. &ldquo;We knew that if you get led down the wrong path it can completely derail your career.&rdquo; But if there&rsquo;s a theme in CHVRCHES&rsquo; world as they prepare to release their third record, Love Is Dead, it&rsquo;s willful, determined openness, both ideologically - more on that in a minute &ndash; and in terms of actual creative process.<\/p>\n<p>This time around, instead of Lauren disappearing for days at a time, the trio stayed in the same room even while Lauren was writing lyrics. As a result, the album &ldquo;feels a lot more coherent,&rdquo; she says. Lauren also consciously pulled from a different psychic well when writing those lyrics, one that's less introspective and more expansive and imagistic. &ldquo;I tried to write less about romantic love specifically,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And more about the overarching concept of love.&rdquo; And, for the first time ever, CHVRCHES opened their proverbial doors to outside influence. The Eurythmics&rsquo; Dave Stewart served as the band&rsquo;s de facto mentor, providing insight Lauren says &ldquo;really pushed us to focus on the artistic integrity of the album and everything that surrounds it.&rdquo; Steve Mac co-produced the soaring ode to hope, &ldquo;Miracle.&rdquo; And thanks to some extremely productive time spent in what Lauren calls his &ldquo;Aladdin&rsquo;s Cave,&rdquo; Greg Kurstin (Adele, Sia) wound up co-producing eight of the record&rsquo;s twelve tracks. &ldquo;We had similar musical tastes and we clicked in the writing process pretty quickly,&rdquo; Kurstin recalls. &ldquo;I got to pull out all of the things I don&rsquo;t have a chance to normally use.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The result is the purest ever distillation of CHVRCHES&rsquo; signature pretty gloom. &ldquo;It makes more sense than anything else we&rsquo;ve made because it most accurately represents us,&rdquo; says Martin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always had this super difficult side to us &ndash; artistic and introspective and angry, but then we also fully embrace commercial music,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;When we talked about this album, before we even made it, we talked about it that way, we talked about there being two sides to the band. With Love Is Dead, we&rsquo;ve broadened the appeal, but there are moments that are more difficult than anything we&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This conscious move towards openness in the creative process reflects a bigger, deeper existential theme as well. &ldquo;We live in a time where the death of empathy is pretty evident,&rdquo; Lauren explains. &ldquo;You turn on the news and see story after story about how selfish and unkind people are, but also stories of strength and resilience and resistance. How do we deal with both those things?&rdquo; That question, of how to honor our justifiable despair about the state of the world, while moving towards hope and love, mirrors CHVRCHES&rsquo; sonic blend of dualities. As Lauren exhorts in &ldquo;ii&rdquo;, the instrumental \/ spoken word intro to album closer &ldquo;Wonderland&rdquo;:<\/p>\n<p>Truth exists somewhere between the dark and the light<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that quest for balance that runs throughout Love Is Dead.<\/p>\n<p>Lead single &ldquo;Get Out&rdquo; is a sprawling crescendo of heartbroken joy, and the album&rsquo;s opening track, &ldquo;Graffiti,&rdquo; with it&rsquo;s lilting syncopated backbeat follows suit. &ldquo;Wrote our names along the bathroom walls, graffiti-ing our hearts across the stalls,&rdquo; Lauren sings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for my whole life to grow old and now we never will.&rdquo; The song captures a sense of perspective on the passage of time. &ldquo;Growing up and realizing things aren&rsquo;t going to be the way you thought they would be,&rdquo; the singer explains. &ldquo;The feeling of Stand By Me, &lsquo;I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, did you?&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the slinky &ldquo;Deliverance,&rdquo; which personifies that classic CHVRCHES blend of punk ethos with a pure pop sound. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hear people singing on the radio about the hypocrisy of religion,&rdquo; says Iain, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s exciting about it. We were thinking about Like a Prayer era Madonna, and Nick Cave, and Depeche Mode&rsquo;s Songs of Faith and Devotion.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The band doesn&rsquo;t consider their music expressly political, per se, but the urgent, brightly haunted &ldquo;Graves,&rdquo; with lyrics like &ldquo;they&rsquo;re leaving bodies in stairwells and washing up on the shore\/you can look away while they&rsquo;re dancing on our graves\/if you don&rsquo;t have a heart I can offer you mine,&rdquo; feels abject and despairing yet joyful in a decidedly topical way. And on, &ldquo;Miracle,&rdquo; Mayberry questions &ldquo;I feel like but I&rsquo;m falling but I&rsquo;m trying to fly, where does all the good go?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of politics, the dreamy &ldquo;Heaven\/Hell,&rdquo; with lyrics like, &ldquo;Is it right if I&rsquo;m a perfect actress\/Playing the princess in distress?\/Is it alright if I save myself and\/If I clean up my own mess?\/Is it enough yet, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve had enough?&rdquo; gets at an issue CHVRCHES have been dealing with since their very first Twitter follower: what it&rsquo;s like to be a rock band with a female frontperson. From the jump, Lauren has been outspoken about the vitriolic sexism and misogyny she was expected to tolerate merely because she&rsquo;s a female human being singing on a stage. Hers is a perspective that has found much greater support in this last year, which is great, obviously. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s healthy that it&rsquo;s in the mainstream,&rdquo; Martin says, &ldquo;of course, but she was getting fucking slaughtered five years ago, for saying stuff that&rsquo;s now everywhere I look. Lauren stood up against this kind of behavior on day one.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And she paid a price. Unlike her bandmates, who, by the time CHVRCHES formed, had already logged a lot of years in other groups, Lauren&rsquo;s entr&eacute;e to the rock and roll life was more trial by fire. &ldquo;I was 23 when I met Iain, 24 when we started this band and I&rsquo;m thirty now,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to grow up in front of people.&rdquo; From the very beginning, &ldquo;there was a lot of trepidation on my part,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;As a woman in any industry but especially as a woman in the entertainment industry, I knew how people talk about you. How they perceive you. Even before the first record came out I could see all these monsters in the trees already. Some of those monsters turned out to be real. Some of them did not.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of what Love Is Dead is about: growing up, &ldquo;coming to terms with the fact that there are great things in the world and there are awful things in the world and that you can&rsquo;t get one without the other,&rdquo; Lauren says. It&rsquo;s that duality, again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fucked, the world is fucked,&rdquo; Iain summarizes, with a smile. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s an ellipses at the end. It&rsquo;s Love Is Dead&hellip;. Like, how did we get to this point? And how do we move on from this point? It&rsquo;s Love Is Dead, we&rsquo;re fucked, what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_chvrches_9_26_05_AM_2_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CHVRCHES"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chvrches\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3CjlHNtplJyTf9npxaPl5w"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chvrches"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/chvrch.es\/?fbclid=IwAR0p9Lb5eNxpB0dYroMU65vv27_1bZL9AppnzqZtzg6OPG7X1OZ48_YgERs"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCDgEglMcFTNpDbGEeQcummw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"02\/12\/2019 09:29:28 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"bleachers":{"id":"5975","name":"Bleachers","friendly_url":"bleachers","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>After building a devoted fan-base through a year and a half of non-stop touring behind his band Bleachers&rsquo; well-received debut album&nbsp;<em>Strange Desire<\/em>, Jack Antonoff was spending time in studios in Los Angeles and Atlanta spit-balling ideas for a second album when he had a powerful realization. It struck him, as he was sitting in hip-hop producers Organized Noize&rsquo;s studio in Atlanta, that the records that meant so much to him growing up&mdash; are rooted in a specific place. &ldquo;They came from somewhere!&rdquo; he says excitedly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an energy there and the artist is telling a story of how they were raised. It's a sound from a city, and they&rsquo;re planting a flag in that city and saying, &lsquo;This is what it's like to live here.&rsquo;\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The New Jersey-born, New York-based Antonoff knew he needed to go home to the East Coast and build a studio. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you have to go sit in your bedroom and hear the music on the speakers you heard&nbsp;<em>Graceland&nbsp;<\/em>on the first time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You gotta listen through the speakers you heard Smashing Pumpkins on the radio the first time. I had to get back to that space. So I did. I grabbed all this shit from my childhood bedroom in New Jersey and built a studio in my apartment in New York and I literally didn't leave it. I thought, &lsquo;This album is going to sound like New York and New Jersey and the actual space I grew up in, in the most specific way. And that, to me, is the most I can offer.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was there in that room &mdash; surrounded by posters and flyers from punk shows he saw as a kid and his old baseball trophies and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;<\/em>figurines &mdash; that Antonoff created the epic, synth-driven anthems that appear on Bleachers&rsquo; second album entitled&nbsp;<em>Gone Now<\/em>, which is set for release on June 2, 2017. As a result, the album sounds like &ldquo;the way the space looks,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It sounds like someone alone in their room, wrestling with their thoughts. It sounds like someone trying to create something very direct and simple amongst the chaos.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Critics praised&nbsp;<em>Strange Desire<\/em>&rsquo;s modern nostalgia and remarked that the &rsquo;80s-influenced songs could have served as a soundtrack to a never-made high-school-themed John Hughes film. On that album, Antonoff set emotional meditations on anxiety, depression, loss and picking yourself up after a tragedy (in his case, the death of his younger sister from a brain tumor when Antonoff was 18 and his struggled with a panic disorder in the aftermath) against a backdrop of earworm melodies and shouty choruses on songs like the gold-certified &ldquo;I Wanna Get Better&rdquo; (which topped&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>&rsquo;s Alternative chart) and &ldquo;Rollercoaster.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The songs were about growing up and still sort of existing in the past,&rdquo; Antonoff says. &ldquo;The crux of the new album is my desperately trying to find a way to become some version of an adult, and not just be a giant child. I thought a lot about things like, &lsquo;Where do I want to go from here? Do I want to be a person who has this extremely vibrant relationship with their art, but their life suffers in a million other places? Where do I want to go with my life?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Antonoff sought to answer those questions on every song on the album. On &ldquo;I Miss Those Days,&rdquo; he pines for a simpler time when &ldquo;I knew I was fucked up and didn&rsquo;t know why I was fucked up,&rdquo; he says referencing the years he spent as a high-schooler touring with his first punk band, Outline, &ldquo;driving around in a van and playing to no one. I was lost, but I miss those days because there&rsquo;s a weight to having a purpose in something.&rdquo; On &ldquo;Hate That You Know Me&rdquo; Antonoff realizes that when you build a life with someone and make plans for the future, &ldquo;it makes you really exposed to the ways in which you&rsquo;re a disaster,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this accountability that is so intense. But it&rsquo;s also about how amazing that can be if you&rsquo;re willing to go there with someone.&rdquo; Then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get Married,&rdquo; which Antonoff wrote the day after Donald Trump was elected. &ldquo;Marriage is such a wild, absurd concept, but the world was falling&nbsp;down into flames around my eyes, and I wanted to write this absurd celebration song that could play at weddings for the next hundred years.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On each track, Antonoff searches for ways to illuminate humanity&rsquo;s communal emotions, like the fact that no one is exempt from the experience of loss. &ldquo;I think everything I do is always going to be rooted in that,&rdquo; Antonoff says. &ldquo;After my sister died, I started writing lyrics that weren't just angsty teen stuff. That&rsquo;s when I started talking about very intense things. Fourteen years later, I&rsquo;m still reflecting on that loss but through a different lens.&rdquo; Antonoff&rsquo;s current vantage point resonates on the song &ldquo;Everybody Lost Somebody.&rdquo; &ldquo;At my worst moments, I see people on the street and think, &lsquo;Which one of you motherfuckers voted for Trump?&rsquo;&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;At my best moments, I see people on the street and I think, &lsquo;Everybody has lost somebody.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On the album&rsquo;s first single, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Take The Money,&rdquo; Antonoff laments how our society has culturally lost the concept of what selling out means. The song was inspired by his buying a cut-rate phone charger at a Rite Aid when his phone died as he was running late to a meeting. &ldquo;I got there and plugged the phone into the charger and I had this out-of-body experience where I could not believe how cheap the material was,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;And I thought to myself, &lsquo;That's the real problem.&rsquo; Whether you're making art or making a sandwich, you know when something could be better. Don't make it cheap. That's the last thing people need.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As far as what Antonoff feels like people need from him as artist, he says: &ldquo;I feel like they just need me to somehow capture the lightning in a bottle of what it&rsquo;s like to be me, to grow up with loss, and then to try to move through the world within that. All I&rsquo;ve wanted to do my whole life with my work is just take another step closer to myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Bleachers_10_15_02_AM_5_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bleachersmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.bleachersmusic.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bleachersmusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BleachersVEVO"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bleachersmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2eam0iDomRHGBypaDQLwWI"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/31\/2019 12:50:03 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"big-gigantic":{"id":"4924","name":"Big Gigantic","friendly_url":"big-gigantic","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>Big Gigantic established themselves as pioneers of live electronic music with the band's inception in 2008. Now, almost 10 years later, they continue to shape the genre by moving it forward with each new release. The Colorado-based saxophonist\/producer Dominic Lalli and drummer Jeremy Salken, are veterans of blending electronic dance music with their live instruments to create Big G's truly unique sound, that is as thoughtful as it is danceable. Big Gigantic mixes musically mature melodies with addictive beats and samples, that are familiar to a Kanye West or LCD Soundsystem single, and crosses all styles of music from jazz to hip hop, funk to dubstep.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating with a master's degree in jazz from the Manhattan School of Music, Lalli relocated to Boulder and began performing with Salken, experimenting with the idea of interpreting traditional DJ-based music with live instruments. The duo built up early hype in 2008 with local shows and one-offs and have since toured the country countless times enjoying a 90% tour sell out rate. Big Gigantic's transcendent live shows are a showcase of brilliant improvisation and the tightly -- knit bond between Salken and Lalli, who breathlessly alternates between keys, sax and laptop, building a contagious sound that keeps the crowd on its feet.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, the band has cemented themselves as a must see act on the US festival circuit, having performed at every major festival including: Coachella (where a local Indio, CA high school marching band joined them on stage), Lollapalooza, Ultra Music Festival, Hangout, Austin City Limits, Governors Ball, Electric Forest, Outside Lands, and Bonnaroo (where they've appeared both on their own and as Musical Director of Skrillex's 2014 Superjam performing alongside Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley, Robby Krieger from The Doors, Lauryn Hill, and Janelle Monae, among others). Big Gigantic has also appeared internationally at such festivals as Lollapalooza Argentina and Brazil, and Mad Decent Block party India. In 2014, the duo made their debut at the famed Madison Square Garden in New York City supporting Bassnectar.<\/p>\n<p>Big Gigantic have released five full length studio albums to date and three recent singles that have taken the band to new heights including \"Get On Up\" (2015), \"Good Times Roll\" w. GRiZ (2016), and \"The Little Things\" feat. Angela McCluskey (2016). The latter, which is receiving national acclaim with over 1 million downloads, 20+ million streams and landing sync placements everywhere from Fox's breakthrough show 'Empire' to ESPN's Wimbledon 2016; NBA coverage; and Apple's recent release of their new line of MacBook Pros.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond their five-year-running, two-night festival, Rowdytown, at Colorado's famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Big Gigantic is known for giving back to their community and created the Big Gigantic Difference Foundation. With strong partnerships that include local non-profits such as Conscious Alliance, The Kitchen Community, and national organization Electric Family -- the band, in coordination with their fans, have given back both monetarily and with their time through various their #ABigGiganticDifference events. Big Gigantic's most recent album, Brighter Future, reflects their commitment to working closely with the community to make the world a better place.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BigGigantic_3_59_47_PM_2_20_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 2 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 2","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BigGigantic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/biggigantic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7o7mC95EDbJKTcPAAs8C3r"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/biggigantic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.biggigantic.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BigGigantic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/29\/2019 02:29:59 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"sublime-with-rome":{"id":"5045","name":"Sublime with Rome","friendly_url":"sublime-with-rome","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p>The wait is over! Sublime With Rome returns long at last with new music in 2018 to complement their first two album releases, <em>Sirens,<\/em> the 2015 effervescent follow up to the band's 2011 debut release <em>Yours Truly.<\/em> &ldquo;Wicked Heart&rdquo; is the first single off their yet untitled upcoming album to come out around Spring 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\"We had more time, we know each other better now, and we're even better musicians,\" said Rome Ramirez, who was just 20-years-old when he embarked on this journey.<\/p>\n<p>With Sublime bassist and co-founder Eric Wilson anchoring the group, Sublime With Rome are armed with a new album that makes a real statement... their statement. Produced by Rob Cavallo, who has worked with Green Day, My Chemical Romance, Linkiin Park and many more, the latest release is an expression of three musicians who truly get each other and who communicate seamlessly through their instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The luxury of time had a huge impact on their approach to this all-important release, especially since the band went into the studio without any demos or songs ready to go! That might sound terrifying to some musicians, but Sublime With Rome were invigorated by the situation.<\/p>\n<p>\"We didn't have any songs in our pockets,\" the frontman said, confessing that while he liked the spontaneity, it also lit a fire under their collective ass. \"We showed up to this big studio and we had nothing, so we had to make it grassroots. It felt refreshing to make things on the fly. It really came together with all of us in the room and we loved the result.\"<\/p>\n<p>He furthered, \"Everything was recorded live and together. It's a little tighter and edgier than our last two releases. We have a lot of influence from Eric and it definitely shows.\"<\/p>\n<p>Wilson concurred, saying, \"It was great working with Rob, our chemistry was excellent. We had a great time recording the album in a totally organic way. There was no stress, even though we came up with stuff on the fly.\" The album was recorded at famed Sonic Ranch nearby El Paso, Texas and in Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is a whole different feeling now,\" Ramirez admitted. \"Carlos is such a great guy and he is just as lighthearted, which is great on the road, since touring can be so serious and so tough. It has been more fun, really. It is a lot more relaxed, and that helps with everything. It's like that everywhere. Studio. Stage. Bus. Wherever we are. We've moved forward, musically and on stage. He brings a great element.<\/p>\n<p>And while Ramirez pays the utmost respect to the original Sublime entity, since, as he admitted in the past, they were the first band that made him want to make, as opposed to just listen to, music, he knows Sublime With Rome are worthy of fan's undivided attention. \"This summer, I want fans to say, 'I went to see Sublime With Rome and the new music is sick as fuck.' We can do that by continuing to make better and better records,\" he said.<\/p>\n<p>Ramirez even stated that he isn't so much interested in the endgame or results as much as he is interested in writing music that is honest. And it's Wilson who summed up how their new music is such an important record for the band. \"I'm able play music for the love of music, just like I did back then. I am so fortunate to still be able to do it,\" he said.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SublimewithRome_4_29_53_PM_6_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 4 - 9:30 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 4","start_time":"9:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sublimewithrome"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/sublimewithrome.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sublimewithrome"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/sublimewithrome"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sublimewithrome\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3XXrhkZKSGd3CUJQFnx5tQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/21\/2019 04:29:57 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"courtney-barnett":{"id":"4946","name":"Courtney Barnett","friendly_url":"courtney-barnett","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<div class=\"col--2-4 col--with-right-margin\">\n<article class=\"no-border default-article\">\n<p>Courtney Barnett is one of the most distinctive and compelling voices in indie rock, a singer-songwriter who mixes deeply insightful observations with devastating self-assessment.

Perhaps those who best thrive in those scenarios are the ones who can navigate through all noise and continue to evolve and grow, both in their skill sets and as individuals.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, that is an integral part of the Atmosphere story. Over their twenty-year career they have managed to continually tweak and strive to perfect their formula, while neither straying too far off their path, nor resorting to playing it safe. Starting at 1997&rsquo;s <em>Overcast<\/em>, the group&rsquo;s first official album, and traveling through 18 years of new albums, side projects (e.g. the Sad Clown series and Felt), and various collaborations, all the way up until 2014&rsquo;s <em>Southsiders<\/em> album, Atmosphere&rsquo;s music has evolved in a way that differs from many of their peers and predecessors. A hard look at that evolution doesn&rsquo;t reveal the commonalities of following trends or struggling to fit in, by either over-extending in an effort to stay cool to the younger generation, or succumbing to the pressure people tend to place on artists to maintain the same sound from album to album. Instead, the Atmosphere discography evolves in a natural way.<\/p>\n<p>Musically, Ant has continued to define Atmosphere&rsquo;s sound, ranging from a healthy mixture of upbeat and fun, to the oft more iconic, moody and personal. Through out the 1990s, Ant spent countless hours in his basement with a wealth of records, a keyboard sampler, a turntable and a 4-track, working with a who&rsquo;s who of the Twin Cities&rsquo; Rap talent of that time. Those experiences tuned his ear, molded his work ethic, and shaped his vision. In turn, those lessons have continually become more prominent in the Atmosphere aesthetic, blending live musicians and sampled production with his keen sense of how to compose a well-arranged song.<\/p>\n<p>As for the lyrics, Slug started his passion for rhyming with an obsessive-like penchant for the way words intersect, as well as how those words can be manipulated for unexpected and clever meanings. But, at the same time, early on Slug expressed an interest in doing more than simply proving he could be witty, but also writing about subjects that speak to people personally, as well as emotionally. These practices also naturally helped the Atmosphere fan base to expand beyond the usual independent Hip Hop audience, extending their reach to an alternative audience who also related to the personable appeal and emotional range of both Slug&rsquo;s songwriting and Ant&rsquo;s musical backdrops. Particularly, Slug has been consistently successful in leveraging his understanding for the power of words, recognizing that a song containing the right story or personal perspective can be extremely effective in capturing and holding the listener&rsquo;s attention.<\/p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the impact of Atmosphere&rsquo;s music has been the roots to their long-term success, but their continued rigorous touring and performance schedule has been the vessel for engraining these stories and the legacy of the music into their fan base. Early on in their careers, Atmosphere stepped beyond the genre lines and performed shows through out the Twin Cities with Rock bands, Punk Rock bands, and Jazz Ensembles. This was directly influenced by the fact that both of them were already fans of a wide range of music. Although this was a natural reaction to being a fan of the music, that experience also afforded Atmosphere, and their Rhymesayers peers, the opportunity to witness first-hand the D.I.Y ethos shared by some of these other musical movements. Atmosphere began to apply many of these tactics and work ethics to their growth, which was specifically influential in the development of Atmosphere&rsquo;s approach to touring. These strategies found Atmosphere expanding their tours into cities that few, if any, Rap artists were including in their routing. The result is a storied connection between the artists and the listeners, which has grown into long-term Atmosphere fans passing down that experience to their children and so on, and thus continually ushering in a new generation of Atmosphere fans. Early on in their touring excursions, Atmosphere shows were noted in history for challenging the idea that Hip Hop audiences had to be filled exclusively with scowl-faced males fueled by ego and testosterone. Instead they created an environment that invited women to join in on the party. All of these factors have led to a fan base that ranges from ages 14-54 and beyond, and one that remains solid, as well as ever evolving.<\/p>\n<p>As Atmosphere steps into their 21<sup>st<\/sup>&nbsp;year of making music, Slug &amp; Ant show no signs of slowing, compromising or losing sight of their vision. Nor has time revealed any diminishing of those qualities that have brought them this far. As 2016 swung into gear, Atmosphere had already ended the previous year and led into another with a string of singles, and still have an abundance of music on the way, including their latest album, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Fishing Blues&rdquo;<\/em><\/strong>. The title of the new album speaks directly to the sentiments that opened this bio; Is this the point in the career where Atmosphere chooses to step back, put up the Gone Fishin&rsquo; sign and reminisce about their successes? The answer, a resounding no, is found in the music, a collection of songs that both define and redefine the Atmosphere sound. Their passion and creative spark are as illuminate as ever. Slug and Ant still have plenty of stories to tell&hellip;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Atmosphere_10_13_16_AM_4_5_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Atmosphere\/5455564087"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/rhymesayers.com\/artists\/atmosphere"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/atmosphere"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nT5XrYLo3-I"},{"type":"instagram","link":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/atmosphere"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1GAS0rb4L8VTPvizAx2O9J?si=L1rFA4yrR7CO7v9K8N9Khg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 03:46:17 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"t-pain":{"id":"4934","name":"T-Pain","friendly_url":"t-pain","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>With 60 hit songs under his belt and two Grammy trophies on his mantle, T-Pain has cemented himself as one of the most influential artists of all time.

In his eyes it was clear he was reliving the moment as he told it. On his long-awaited debut album <em>The Autobiography<\/em>, Vic Mensa taps into pivotal moments in his life, reliving each one from one track to the next.<\/p>\n<p>Raised in the nefariously gang-divided South Side of Chicago, Mensa embodied the &ldquo;good kid, mad city&rdquo; narrative. The product of a Ghanian father who is a PhD professor and a white mother who is a physical therapist from upstate New York, Vic&rsquo;s reality was different from the Section 8 kids across the street from his Hyde Park home and the projects up the block. His friends, though multicultural, didn&rsquo;t have the household Mensa had. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t my world when I went home,&rdquo; Vic recalls, emphasizing his liberal multiracial upbringing. &ldquo;But in the eyes of the world I was a Black man, so that&rsquo;s what I grew to become. Certain instances chose my race for me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He punctuates that sentiment with a story from the age of 11, where he was riding his bicycle and pulled off by police who mistook him for another kid who ran from them the day before. That same year he discovered hip-hop, absorbing KRS-One, Public Enemy, and N.W.A. He later met his first street mentor, a graffiti writer who tagged <em>DARE <\/em>and added Vic (who tagged <em>REAK<\/em>) to his Jam graffiti crew. Years of graffiti, battling in school, and sneaking in verses on local rappers&rsquo; tracks in the studio gave Vic Mensa his hip-hop sea legs.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, however, Vic lost his mentor <em>DARE <\/em>to a random act of senseless violence. He details the story on his <em>Autobiography <\/em>cut &ldquo;Heaven On Earth,&rdquo; which includes a dialogue to and from <em>DARE<\/em>. On the track he emphasizes living out his dreams in <em>DARE<\/em>&rsquo;s memory, and given the five years that followed, Vic&rsquo;s accomplished that and then some. As part of the Chicago collective SAVEMONEY with Chance The Rapper and other local upstarts Towkio and Joey Purp, Mensa toured globally and word of his talent traveled fast. His solo debut mixtape <em>INNANETAPE <\/em>in 2013 set the stage for his <em>XXL <\/em>Freshman cover in 2014. He reached the ears of Roc Nation executive Lenny S who introduced Mensa to Jay Z. A Roc Nation deal was the result. Mensa went on to help pen Kanye West&rsquo;s esoteric &ldquo;Wolves&rdquo; track off <em>The Life of Pablo<\/em>, and in the Spring of 2016, Mensa dropped his critically acclaimed EP <em>There&rsquo;s A Lot Going On<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The project brought a level of emotional discourse that Mensa never introduced in previous works. His video for the track &ldquo;16 Shots,&rdquo; brought a graduated level of social commentary as visuals depict Mensa on the run from the cops. That very scenario that almost cost him his life years back by leaping over train tracks during a chase and gripping a voltage-carrying rail where he was nearly electrocuted to death. He has the tattoo of the volts over the scars to prove it. &ldquo;16 Shots&rdquo; also shows dash cam footage of the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald by Chicago police. His full-length debut <em>The Autobiography <\/em>will incorporate many of the unabridged versions of his experiences and thoughts described on the EP.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As I was in the process of writing <em>The Autobiography<\/em>, I found there was an element of storytelling in the songs,&rdquo; Vic says of the album title&rsquo;s origin. &ldquo;It was very autobiographical: no filler, just real recounts of things that have happened in my life.&rdquo; Cuts like the aforementioned &ldquo;Heaven On Earth&rdquo; show Vic coming to terms with life and death, while &ldquo;Homewrecker&rdquo; discusses two tumultuous relationships in his life&mdash;one with a woman named &ldquo;Natalie&rdquo; referenced in previous songs, and another &ldquo;Alexandra.&rdquo; Other songs like &ldquo;Oh My Goodness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spread My Wings&rdquo; also talk about Vic&rsquo;s experiences with love. &ldquo;I talk about relationships that I&rsquo;ve had on this album, and I try to paint full pictures of the good, the bad, and the ugly,&rdquo; he explains.<\/p>\n<p>Getting in the studio with Pharrell Williams and 1500 Or Nothin has given Vic added dimensions to his production, the latter delivering works like the intense &ldquo;We Could Be Free,&rdquo; &ldquo;No More Teardrops,&rdquo; and the electronic-tinged &ldquo;Gorgeous.&rdquo; While Vic Mensa is really just getting started, it seems as though he&rsquo;s lived a thousand lives and <em>The Autobiography <\/em>is proof of that. While Mensa has poured every ounce of his emotions and thoughts into his debut album&mdash;visually reliving them in the music&mdash;his mission remains clear. &ldquo;I just want people to understand me as a young man in this troubled world,&rdquo; the 23-year-old says, &ldquo;with a lot of opinions and experiences, a lot of truths, big ideas, and revolutionary principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In December 2018, Vic released his <em>Hooligans <\/em>EP which received large critical acclaim from Rolling Stone, The Atlantic, Forbes, Pitchfork, FADER, XXL, Vibe and many others. The booming project features collaborations with Ty Dolla $ign, G-Eazy, Charlie Wilson, Lil Herb, G Herbo, Mr. Hudson and Jesse Rutherford (The Neighbourhood).<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_VicMensa_8_44_29_AM_3_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VicMensa1\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/vicmensa\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/27w1NoOLMX7tJMYqcetPyG"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VicMensa"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/vicmensa.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/vicmensa"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2019 08:46:27 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"taking-back-sunday":{"id":"4927","name":"Taking Back Sunday","friendly_url":"taking-back-sunday","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>If you can't believe that Taking Back Sunday have been around for 20 years, you're not alone, because they can't either. Although the pride of Long Island have had a handful of member changes over the years, the current lineup of the band -- vocalist Adam Lazzara, guitarist John Nolan, drummer Mark O'Connell and bassist Shaun Cooper -- have all been there since the beginning. From the band's landmark 2002 debut&nbsp;<em>Tell All Your Friends&nbsp;<\/em>to their most recent full-length, 2016's&nbsp;<em>Tidal Wave<\/em>, Taking Back Sunday have evolved from a key player in the early 2000s emo scene to a genre-defying rock band who have three gold albums without ever ceasing to push the limitations of their sound. This fact is evidenced on&nbsp;<em>Twenty<\/em>, a 21-song collection set for release in January 2019 via Craft Recordings that spans all seven of their full-lengths and solidifies them as an act with a catalog that will undoubtedly outlive them. By now you know the basic history of the band, so we thought it'd be apt to look back at the fact that almost none of it happened...<br \/><br \/>\"When I joined Taking Back Sunday in 1999, it was the first real band that I had ever been a part of, but it never crossed my mind that I would be doing this twenty years later. When I came in to audition it was just [original vocalist] Antonio [Longo] and [founding TBS guitarist and former Movielife member] Eddie Reyes. Eddie had started enough bands that he was like, 'I know how to do this, I can just call one guy.' But it was a crazy thing. When it started out, there was a lot more likelihood that it would fizzle out in a few months than it would last a few years. I tried out, and basically after we jammed for a couple of hours Eddie was like, 'All right, you're in. You have to get some different equipment though... and I'll sell it to you.' I think he sold me a head and cabinet for $200 [that] had to be worth at least $600.\" -&nbsp;<strong><em>John Nolan<br \/><br \/><\/em><\/strong>\"My entry into the band is pretty interesting. One day my brother said, 'Hey, my friend is looking for a drummer and he wanted to know if you wanted to try out.' But once I realized he was talking about Eddie, I had second thoughts. I remembered Eddie was the jerk who would yell at me and Shaun and all of our friends in front of Shaun's house when we would hang out there because he would be going to Movielife practice. So I said, 'No, I don't want to play in a band with that guy.' Then maybe two months later Shaun and I were hanging out [with] my mutual friend at a restaurant where Antonio worked and our friend said, 'Yo, my boy needs a drummer for his band if you want to try out.' The first song I heard was 'Go On' and I was like, 'Wow, this definitely has a lot of potential,' so I agreed. On my first tryout I remember walking in and seeing John, Antonio and then guess who's there? Eddie Reyes. I was like, 'Oh, what's up, man? How are you doing?' That was it.\" -&nbsp;<strong><em>Mark O'Connell<br \/><br \/><\/em><\/strong>\"I didn't know anyone in Taking Back Sunday initially; I just knew who Eddie was because some of the bands from Long Island would play in North Carolina. I had just moved back to Greensboro from Wilmington and I didn't really have anything going on aside from delivering Chinese food, so I really wanted to be playing music. I ended up in a booth with Eddie and Antonio at the after show hangout spot, Waffle House, after an ill-fated Sons Of Abraham show and heard they needed a bass player for their new project. They said, 'Yeah, you should come up.' A couple of weeks later me and my friend Chris drove his 1988 Honda Accord up to New York, I tried out and then drove back. A few weeks later I got a call from Eddie [who] said, 'If you want to do this, we have some shows coming up.' So I flew to Long Island and never came back. Looking back now it's funny because I was like, 'I'm moving to New York, it's going to be so sick.' Then I moved to Long Island and it was kind of a bummer. It was just like North Carolina... only way more crowded.\" -&nbsp;<strong><em>Adam Lazzara<br \/><br \/><\/em><\/strong>Mark and I have played in bands together as long as we've known each other, which is over 30 years. When he joined Taking Back Sunday, I begged him to get me a bass audition. At first Mark told me that since I was so unreliable in our previous bands that he couldn't vouch for me, so I got serious, enrolled in night classes at a local college and tried to get my act together. About a month later, Mark noticed a change but sadly some kid from North Carolina was ditching everything he knew to move to New York to play bass in the band. Adam was a good bass player but he had a manic, magnetic energy on stage that everyone in the crowd was captivated by. Suddenly Antonio was out and Eddie made Adam put down the bass and grab a microphone. Mark got me a tryout for the band December 26, 2000. I played along to the demo day and night, made myself fall in love with those songs and played my first show at our friend's house a few days later on New Year's Eve. -&nbsp;<strong><em>Shaun Cooper<br \/><br \/><\/em><\/strong>The rest is history. Taking Back Sunday may have started out like most of their peers by playing local shows and recording demos; however, unlike most of those peers they went on to sign to a major label, tour alongside Linkin Park and become international superstars. That said, they still speak of the band's early days as if they just happened yesterday. \"I'll never forget, we played Ground Zero in Long Island in 2001 and it was the first show we played where people were singing along and going crazy. It was a tiny place that held 100 people but you could sense something had changed,\" Lazzara recalls. \"After the show I remember we carried some equipment back to John's car and we were sitting in it just not saying anything. We were just thinking, 'that was the best thing ever.' I was starry eyed and staring into space; I couldn't believe that just happened.\" Nolan concurs, adding, \"Even after the band got a lot bigger and did things that were a lot more impressive, that moment was really huge because you could tell something was happening. Everyone was going nuts and that really stands out to me as being one of the defining moments of Taking Back Sunday.\"<br \/><br \/><em>Twenty&nbsp;<\/em>is a celebration not only of those career-defining moments but of the landmark albums that chronicle the band's story: 2002's&nbsp;<em>Tell All Your Friends<\/em>, 2004's&nbsp;<em>Where You Want To Be<\/em>, 2006's&nbsp;<em>Louder Now<\/em>, 2009's&nbsp;<em>New Again<\/em>, 2011's&nbsp;<em>Taking Back Sunday<\/em>, 2014's&nbsp;<em>Happiness Is&nbsp;<\/em>and 2016's&nbsp;<em>Tidal Wave<\/em>, all of which are represented on this collection. Whether your introduction to the band was singing along to \"A Decade Under The Influence\" in a sweaty club or hearing \"MakeDamnSure\" or \"Sink Into Me\" on the radio,&nbsp;<em>Twenty&nbsp;<\/em>is a look back at some of the highlights from this unlikely group of musical misfits. Additionally, fans will be able to hear two newly recorded songs, which hint at the direction that Taking Back Sunday are heading in the coming years. Musical legacy aside, ultimately what's most impressive is the fact that after two decades and countless successes, Taking Back Sunday have managed to preserve that initial spark that excited them as teenagers.<br \/><br \/>That fact alone is one worth celebrating, so turn it up and listen loud.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TakingBackSunday_10_46_55_AM_1_18_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TakingBackSunday"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/takingbacksunday\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/24XtlMhEMNdi822vi0MhY1"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tbsofficial"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.takingbacksunday.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/takingbacksunday"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/29\/2019 03:08:42 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"rodrigo-y-gabriela":{"id":"5051","name":"Rodrigo y Gabriela","friendly_url":"rodrigo-y-gabriela","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Five years since their last album, Mexican acoustic rock guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela are ready to embark on the next chapter of their remarkable story, with the release of the most ambitious music of their twenty year career together.<\/p>\n<p>Entitled &lsquo;Mettavolution&rsquo;, the white-hot new album brings together Rod and Gab&rsquo;s shimmering, hummingbird flourishes and extraordinary engine room rhythm section, laser focused on melody, energy and beat.

The song became the launching point for each note that followed, the bar under which each track was measured. It contains a dynamic force, a surging energy, that resonates throughout the album, and reflects back on everything Dashboard Confessional has achieved in the past two decades.<\/p>\n<p>At first \"We Fight\" was simple in its intent, written about the Florida music scene where Chris grew up. It was a place where everyone was accepted and no one was judged, a island of inclusivity worth defending. Chris and his compatriots fought for the scene and fostered it, encouraging individualism and non-judgment. But as Chris was writing it, the song transformed into something bigger. \"The election happened and suddenly the song felt relevant because of this climate of intolerance and aggression and hate,\" Chris says. \"We regressed as a nation to this place where people embrace backwards thinking. So the fight that started in our scene still felt relevant. It seems like it's going to last longer than we'd like, but we have to stay here to fight.\"<\/p>\n<p>The eight songs that follow on Crooked Shadows, Dashboard Confessional's first release since 2009's Alter The Ending, are connected, threaded together by the idea that it's essential to balance hope with anger. That we can reject the place where society has recently fallen and find ways to lift ourselves back up. The album, recorded in Chris's basement over the past two years and produced by Chris and Jonathan Clark and co- produced by Colin Brittain, feels intimate and emotionally wrought. The musicians weren't looking for perfection during the recording process. Instead, they focused on sincere snapshots of the songs, many of which, like \"Heartbeat Here,\" were laid down only moments after being written. The idea was to get as close as possible to the feeling Chris had while writing the song when recording it.<\/p>\n<p>\"It reminds me of my first record,\" Chris says. \"I think there's something people connected to with that hand-crafted nature, possibly more than the later records. This was a chance to combine the two schools of thought. It can be well done and homespun at the same time.\"<\/p>\n<p>The title from the album comes from \"Crooked Shadows,\" an intimate track Chris wrote with Dashboard Confessional's guitarist Armon Jay Cheek and Jonathan Howard. The inspiration came to Chris during a walk around town with his wife. They weren't getting along, possibly because Chris had been away too long on tour, and there was an unspoken feeling of upset. Suddenly the storm clouds broke and the sun filtered behind them, casting a shadow of two people holding hands on a nearby staircase.<\/p>\n<p>\"It was really beautiful,\" Chris says. \"I thought to myself, 'Look how beautiful that is in its imperfections.' I realized that's why our relationships works -- because it's imperfect but beautiful and important enough that there we were holding hands anyway. It was a moment where it wasn't easy, but where we were still together not getting along. Those crooked shadows were together in spite of it all.\"<\/p>\n<p>The closing track, \"Just What To Say,\" is the most personally revealing song Chris has ever written -- which, he knows, is a bold statement. The acoustic number is quiet and reflective, looking inward in a way that feels deeply relatable. It's about admitting and accepting flaws, but it's also about embracing the better aspects of your own humanity. \"It's my honest assessment of who I am at my best and who I am not at my best,\" the singer says. \"It starts with me not at my best, but I think I explain myself well enough that by the end you get a better opinion of me.\"<\/p>\n<p>Crooked Shadows feels like the opening of a new chapter in Dashboard Confessional's career, but it also revisits their past. For Chris, there were several roads the band could have walked down after the success of their first few albums. They picked one -- and he's grateful for that -- but he's always wondered what was down the other roads. Crooked Shadows is one possible answer to that question. It's also a reminder of the band's skill when it comes to penning deeply and unabashedly emotional songs, an aesthetic that influenced countless younger artists. Over the years, Dashboard Confessional has made it enviable to bare your soul in a song and to be unashamed of any feelings that may arrive. Chris and his fellow musicians have found a new perspective on the world in these songs, one that only comes with more life experience, but those exposed emotions remain.<\/p>\n<p>\"I'm searching for answers to questions I haven't even thought of,\" Chris says. \"A lot of writers are trying to discover who they are and what their place is in the world -- that's part of the inquisitive nature of people who gravitate to artists expression. It's exhilarating because not having the answers is the impetus to writing songs. When I sit down to write I'm in that place where I can attempt to describe the search for the answers -- or the answers themselves. It's hard to pinpoint which one you get in a song, even when you've written that song, but it's the reason I do this.\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DashboardConfessional_3_21_14_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 5 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 5","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DashboardConfessional"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dashboardconfessional\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4ERtgeBbWRkFzIz6LaFCeY"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dashboardmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.dashboardconfessional.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DashboardVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/26\/2019 11:03:18 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"switchfoot":{"id":"5054","name":"SWITCHFOOT","friendly_url":"switchfoot","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>After 10 albums, multiple hit singles, millions of records sold, a GRAMMY Award and 20 years of touring, in late 2017, SWITCHFOOT put the brakes on. The successful release and tour for their most recent album,&nbsp;<em>WHERE THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH<\/em>had concluded, and the San Diego-based quintet decided to take a long deserved, much needed hiatus. Their goals? To think on difficult, important questions about the band and themselves personally, including: &ldquo;Why are we doing this?&rdquo; The answers weren&rsquo;t long in coming and are musically evident in the 14 remarkable songs that make up&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>, a creative juggernaut spawned by singer Jon Foreman&rsquo;s realization that the answer to &ldquo;why?&rdquo; was to &ldquo;pursue joy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Joy became the paramount goal in his life and music. &ldquo;Joy is an incredible motivator,&rdquo; says Jon: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only to be found in the moment, not in the past or future. That&rsquo;s what music is to us: The ever-present joy of the ever-present now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>During the hiatus, Jon&rsquo;s positive immediacy inspired songs that he had to get out. Creative openness without a goal resulted in an electric, wide-ranging collection. &ldquo;There was no &lsquo;should&rsquo; or &lsquo;ought.&rsquo; It was a beautiful freedom. Songs we wrote didn&rsquo;t have to turn into anything, as long as we were pursuing joy. That&rsquo;s where this record was born.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The results of that pursuit include the infectious, title track; the get-your-lighters out, sway-along &ldquo;ALL I NEED&rdquo;; and the edgy excellence of &ldquo;VOICES.&rdquo; Then there&rsquo;s a trippily wonderful departure in the Beatles-esque &ldquo;DIG NEW STREAMS,&rdquo; a tune drummer Chad Butler calls an &ldquo;odyssey. It breaks so many rules: Structure, tempo, arrangement, style. I love that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Lyrically,&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t dwell on the world&rsquo;s fraught social and political situations, rather, it&rsquo;s an answer that offers an antidote to them. SWITCHFOOT observe that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re living in a time where it feels like hatred, fear, war, pain, anger is the native tongue of our species, that these dark words are our language. For me,&rdquo; says Jon, &ldquo;Holding my infant son in the middle of the night reminds me of how helpless we all start off. All of us, everywhere, were comforted, held, given a bottle;&nbsp;we were not hated into the world, we were loved into the world. Love is our native tongue, our common bond. And&nbsp;when fear and hatred are put in their proper place joy is available to us. That aligns well with joy, which is only available when fear, hatred, all those things are put in their proper place, cast aside by love.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The time off for reflection &ldquo;started a beautiful season for me, of falling in love with music and songwriting all over again,&rdquo; says Tim, who co-founded SWITCHFOOT when he was just 17. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sneak into the band studio and write and play. But then I noticed some scribbled lyrics left by my brother. He&rsquo;d been doing the same thing.&rdquo; Chad, too, admits to dropping by the studio. &ldquo;I ran into Jon there. He played me a couple new songs, including &lsquo;LET IT HAPPEN,&rsquo; which is poignant lyrically, coming from the space of not having a plan or agenda.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Jon believes that where the songs arise from is crucial; &ldquo;ulterior motives can ruin even the best of intentions.&rdquo; The idea of &ldquo;let it happen,&rdquo; along with &ldquo;pursuing joy,&rdquo; gave a shape to the lyrical ideas and music and spirit that went into&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE.<\/em>&nbsp; As SWITCHFOOT enjoyed the time off and, the avid surfers&mdash;reveled in the inspirational immensity of the Pacific Ocean&mdash;music flowed easily, merely for the joy of it. The band&rsquo;s &lsquo;time off&rsquo; turned out to be particularly creative and their prolific nature clicked in, writing nearly 100 songs for the project. The question arose: &ldquo;Are we making an album?&rdquo; The answer was clearly yes, and songs were culled to a manageable number to be produced by the band, along with OneRepublic bassist and multi-instrumentalist Brent Kutzle.<\/p>\n<p>The tunes coalesced quickly. &ldquo;THE HARDEST ART&rdquo; got a beautiful boost thanks to vocals added by Kaela Sinclair, of the French electronic outfit M83. For his part, Tim got rid of equipment and bought &ldquo;old basses, new to me,&rdquo; to change up and challenge his sound and approach. Jon wrote lyrics that are an oft-philosophical combination and of the personal and universal. For example, &ldquo;VOICES&rdquo; was inspired by a homeless man who lived at the beach. &ldquo;He was a nice guy,&rdquo; says Jon, &ldquo;who always wore aluminum foil on his head to block out the signals and voices he heard&hellip; Looking back I think he was bipolar. But I realized there&rsquo;s always voices in our heads, all of us, an inner dialogue or diatribe.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&nbsp;marks the 11th record since 1997&rsquo;s debut,&nbsp;<em>THE LEGEND OF CHIN<\/em>, which started SWITCHFOOT on a path of critical and fan acclaim for albums including 2003&rsquo;s multi-platinum breakthrough&nbsp;<em>THE BEAUTIFUL LETDOWN,<\/em>&nbsp;the GRAMMY award-<em>winning HELLO HURRICANE&nbsp;<\/em>(2009), and&nbsp;<em>FADING WEST<\/em>, which was also the name of a documentary on the band. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For an album that &ldquo;snuck up on&rdquo; SWITCHFOOT, there&rsquo;s a remarkable cohesion among the songs. Of course, 20 years together can do that to a band. A band that moves easily among the world of modern rock but mystifies those who try to pigeonhole them. &ldquo;Since the beginning, SWITCHFOOT never fit into a musical genre,&rdquo; notes Chad. &ldquo;We all come from different musical upbringings, and we believe any good playlist has diversity.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Approaching the music on&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&nbsp;with kid-like enthusiasm combined with the years spent honing their craft makes&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&nbsp;a rare gem. &ldquo;We channeled Queen, ELO, the Kinks; our favorite albums from the past. Albums with guitar solos,&rdquo; laughs Jon, who says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d play solos over and over just because they were fun! But we didn&rsquo;t want to make a throwback album, and Brent was great at marrying the sensibility of our roots with the present and beyond. We took fun risks.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Those risks paid off in songs that the listener can interact with on multiple levels. If&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&rsquo;s tunes are approachable and memorable, the album also has a heady goal.&nbsp;<em>NATIVE TONGUE<\/em>&nbsp;is, Jon says, &lsquo;An attempt to be a loving embrace of all the human souls who have been weighed down by the times. It&rsquo;s a chance for all of us to be reminded of what brings us together, not what tears us apart. My hope, for this record,&rdquo; Jon concludes, &ldquo;is that it would be a reminder that there are new streams available for us to travel down, and that hatred is not our language, love is our&nbsp;native tongue.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Switchfoot_4_45_43_PM_4_3_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/switchfoot"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/switchfoot.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/switchfoot"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MLCQudlKBKg"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/switchfoot\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6S58b0fr8TkWrEHOH4tRVu"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/16\/2019 02:50:44 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"judah--the-lion":{"id":"4978","name":"Judah & the Lion","friendly_url":"judah--the-lion","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<p>For Judah &amp; the Lion, the last two years should've been the best of their lives as the Nashville band toured behind a powerful single and a genre-upending album, sharing stages with heroes and playing to oceans of fans. But as everything was coming together for them, singer-guitarist Judah Akers' family was falling apart in a hail of alcoholism and affairs, death and divorce. From that tension comes <em>Pep Talks<\/em>, the trio's third LP and a hard left turn into deeply personal terrain. Knowing they had something new on their hands, Judah, Brian Macdonald (mandolin), and Nate Zuercher (banjo) took their time crafting a set of songs that not only shores up their one-of-one sound&mdash;a heart-pounding whirl of folk, bluegrass, rock, hip-hop and electronic production&mdash;but takes the listener on a bracingly candid, surprisingly anthemic journey from the kind of pain that tears your whole world apart to the sort of hard-won hope that can bridge the deepest of rifts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Up to this point, the band's message has mostly been: 'Live your best life! Pursue your dreams! Follow your heart!'\" says Judah, \"We had to start this record with broken-ness, with this cry that says, 'I don't want to hide this from anyone anymore. I'm going through something. I need help.'\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first songs released from <em>Pep Talks<\/em> also open the album and they drop us right into Judah's struggle. Epic overture \"Pep Talk\" is a wordless swell of anxiety, woe, resolve and musical might that feeds right into \"Quarter-Life Crisis.\" There, over a piano-pounding track that'd make Arcade Fire shout along, Judah admits to feeling alone and powerless, in need of support. With the next track \"Why Did You Run?\"&mdash;a Zedd-evoking trip into organic-goes-digital EDM&mdash;we start to see why he feels that way as the people he used to rely on end up in jail or absentee, leaving behind \"a lost kid looking for a home he once knew.\" And on \"i'm ok.\" he spells it out: his aunt has died (of an overdose), his parents are splitting up for good, and he's on the road, unable to face it all. The song goes through a transformation both aural and lyrical, from upbeat rock to moody rap as Judah first brushes off his friends' concerns, then admits, <em>\"I'm not okay, come get my pain.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"In the middle of all of this it was very hard for me to admit to myself I wasn't doing good,\" says Judah. \"I'd get texts from people checking in. I'd always say, 'I'm okay,' but inside I was almost annoyed, which is an awful response, like, 'Just stop asking. I don't want to think about it.' That forced me to go, 'No, this is exactly why I do need to think about it: I need to process things.'\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many of <em>Pep Talks<\/em>' songs were written on the bus after the band's high energy shows, emotions and scenes flooding Judah's head as he struggled to sleep. Empathy courses through yearning Kacey Musgraves duet \"Pictures\" as he writes from the point of view of his mom packing up the family home. Entropy reigns in the relentless, synth-and-banjo-driven \"Over My Head\" where he tries in vain to push the pain away: <em>\"Hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat.\"<\/em> Acoustic tearjerker \"Queen Songs\" is steeped in nostalgia, Judah recalling childhood memories of his mother back before her drinking got too bad to ignore, while its surging coda \"human.\" (which incorporates a poem by Judah and his sister) attempts to find common ground in the present. And then there's the snarling, trap-addled, bass-dropping \"Don't Mess with My Mama,\" inspired by an actual fistfight between Judah and his dad over the latter's affairs in the middle of all the Akers family strife.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"We wanted a song that matched the level of intensity I was feeling at the time, being so angry at someone you love so much,\" says Judah. \"For the last chorus, we all took our shirts off, got our headphones on, turned it up way too loud and started screaming nonsense into the mic.\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Judah &amp; the Lion has been a family unto itself since forming at Nashville's Belmont University in 2011. Judah was from nearby Cookeville, an aspiring baseball player with a secret love for folk guitar. Brian came from Chicagoland and was mostly obsessed with piano. Nate, a Coloradan, was a son of symphony players but preferred metal. Their differences were their strength as they shaped their sound over a bluegrass-heavy debut, <em>Kids These Days<\/em>, and its mold-breaking follow-up <em>Folk Hop n' Roll<\/em>, both produced by Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) and made in under two weeks. For <em>Pep Talks<\/em>, they took three months, coproduced as a band alongside two friends (Brian's college roomie Drew Long and local artist Daniel James), and kept the guest list tight: drummer Darren King (ex Mutemath), a hero to the guys; Kacey, whose transcendent <em>Golden Hour<\/em> was a powerful influence; and genre-flouting tour buddy, Jon Bellion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"We've never had an environment that was so relaxed&mdash;where everybody could speak so freely and be themselves and have fun,\" says Brian. Nate adds, \"Judah's openness was inspiring, and I feel so much more ownership with this project because we all decided to believe in ourselves.\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the swaggering, bouncy Bellion feature, \"Passion Fashion\" testifies to that sentiment as Judah sings <em>\"I got ambition, yeah I'm on a mission ... there's no stopping me now, Imma do me.\"<\/em> If that lyric seems out of step with what you know of <em>Pep Talks<\/em> so far, that's because we skipped ahead a few songs. Just past the LP's halfway mark, Judah starts healing. \"7000x\" is a humble fight song whose moody groove nods to those other underdogs (and friends) Twenty One Pilots. The dubwise \"JOYBOY\" beams its powerful mantra. \"Goofballerz\" is pure release, a self-aware ditty that captures the humor and ease of the band's gigs, while \"Dance with Ya\" shows our host at home with his wife, seeking tranquility. The philosophy that Judah slowly forged by the fire of his trials is laid out on the battered but bliss-beaming \"Alright (Frick It!)\": <em>\"No matter how bad all this gets, I can't stop this voice in my head \/ This voice in my head says, We&rsquo;re gonna be alright!\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"That chorus really started as a motto between me and my siblings&mdash;a message of camaraderie and triumph to carry us through,\" says Judah. The extended ring finger in the album art signifies this too&mdash;it's an old Akers family sign meaning, roughly, \"frick it.\" \"With these songs, we want to establish a culture of no matter what you're going through&mdash;depression, family stuff, hard times, whatever&mdash;there's always reason to move forward. At the end of the day, we're in this together.\"<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It's a thing you can actually feel as you work your way through <em>Pep Talks<\/em>. The group got closer and better as Nate and Brian encouraged Judah to share his truth, and the intentionality of his recovery was in turn reflected by the music. Similarly, once they got to the other side, the Akers too were in a better place: stronger, realer and more honest about who they are, where they've been and what's next. Because the point of sharing all this hard truth isn't to shame anyone; It's the opposite really, the idea that being broken and admitting it is unifying&mdash;fallibility is our most common trait and if we sing about it from a stage, others will sing along. To that end, if \"Quarter- Life Crisis\" was a cry for help, album closer \"Family \/ Best Is Yet to Come\" is an answer. Judah's mom speaks first, leaving him a teary voicemail after her first listen through <em>Pep Talks<\/em>. And soon we hear his reply before the song builds to its staggering crescendo: \"You're not alone in this.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JudahTheLion_3_24_09_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 26 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 26","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/judahandthelion"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/judahandthelion\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3wWtfT7S2uVJJ3hGZlOLkZ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/judahandthelion"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.judahandthelion.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC46vPb56lPxuyu5fxyvU7FQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/07\/2019 02:40:46 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"catfish-and-the-bottlemen":{"id":"5042","name":"Catfish and the Bottlemen","friendly_url":"catfish-and-the-bottlemen","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>Catfish and the Bottlemen are practically of &ldquo;no fixed abode&rdquo; due to near constant touring and recording since 2014, when their platinum-certified debut album <em>The Balcony <\/em>surfaced.

Just months after debuting at #5 on&nbsp;<u>Billboard<\/u>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>21 Under 21&nbsp;<\/em>list in 2016, the Pittsburgh-born artist emerged as the youngest honoree on Forbes&rsquo; 30 Under 30 music list in 2017. Newly signed to Interscope Records, Daya is set to deliver a sophomore album that finally shows the full depth of her talent and scope of her artistry.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing songs since I was 12, but working on this record helped me to find my voice in a whole new way,&rdquo; says Daya, who co-wrote every track on the album. &ldquo;Being in the studio every day and experimenting with new sounds has opened up all these parts of me that I didn&rsquo;t even know were there.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Made with producers like Joel Little (Lorde, Tove Lo), Stargate (Sam Smith, Rihanna), and Oren Yoel (Miley Cyrus, Tori Kelly), the follow-up to 2016&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Sit Still, Look Pretty&nbsp;<\/em>takes on a more expansive sound while further proving Daya&rsquo;s gift for unforgettable melody. Along with bringing elements of urban and electronic music to her brightly arranged breed of pop, Daya embraces a soulful sensibility closely shaped by her lifelong love of R&amp;B and her experience in studying jazz piano.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Before this album I felt like I had to fit my songs into some kind of a mold, but now I&rsquo;m less worried about keeping everything in a particular structure,&rdquo; says Daya, a classically trained pianist who began playing at the age of three, and later picked up guitar, ukulele, saxophone, and flute. &ldquo;The process feels much more free-flowing now, where I&rsquo;m just trying out different ideas and seeing where they lead me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That richer sonic palette serves as the backdrop for Daya&rsquo;s more emotionally complex lyrics, an element echoed by her stunning vocal range. While she notes that her songwriting has long been a conduit for self-discovery, she&rsquo;s recently felt more compelled to explore emotions that tend to go ignored in pop. &ldquo;Writing these new songs, I wanted to continue with the theme of empowerment from my older music, but also get even more real about things I&rsquo;ve gone through and what&rsquo;s in my heart,&rdquo; Daya says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On lead single &ldquo;New&rdquo;&mdash;a fantastically intense powerhouse offering up both intimate confession and massive beats&mdash;Daya sheds light on the struggle of owning up to your vulnerability. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually very closed off in relationships; I&rsquo;ll make all these excuses about why a situation isn&rsquo;t good for me or why I don&rsquo;t need this person in my life,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;&lsquo;New&rsquo; is about accepting that you have real feelings for someone and learning how to let them in, which is definitely a new perspective for me.&rdquo; Hailed by Billboard as a &ldquo;dynamic, bass-thumping pop anthem that tugs at the heartstrings,&rdquo; the track is accompanied by a gorgeously cinematic video conceptualized by Daya (who also played a key role in creating its chaotic choreography).<\/p>\n<p>Throughout her second album, Daya also touches on fragile emotions like feeling unable to move on from past relationships (on catchy &ldquo;Outta My Head&rdquo;) and trying to explain her quick fuse (on the sharp story-telling &ldquo;Temper&rdquo;). On &ldquo;Safe&rdquo;&mdash;penned the day after the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas&mdash;Daya turns in a gently devastating vocal performance perfectly suited to her thoughtful meditation on innocence and disillusionment.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was thinking how sad and crazy it is that these things happen so often now, they don&rsquo;t even affect us the same way anymore,&rdquo; Daya says of &ldquo;Safe.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wanted look at why we&rsquo;re so numb and why we haven&rsquo;t done more to stop this sort of violence, but I also wanted to address that on a very personal level. It ended up becoming a song that looks back on the past, and asks why we can&rsquo;t all feel as safe as when we were younger.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Born Grace Tandon, she devoted much of her childhood to honing her own musical talents. &nbsp;Beginning with the piano (age 3), this Pittsburgh native picked up multiple instruments and later found her voice to accompany the songs she began writing. Her writing ability quickly garnered the attention of professionals in the music industry who invited to her to Los Angeles for her first co-writing sessions at age 16. &nbsp;It was during this first trip West that &ldquo;Hide Away&rdquo; was born. Shortly thereafter, she became an independent artist, &ldquo;Hide Away&rdquo; was released and she adopted the moniker of Daya -- the Hindi translation of her first name, and a nod to her Indian heritage. The track made an instant splash and transformed her into a full-time singer-songwriter who took to the road promoting her songs while remotely finishing high school.<\/p>\n<p>Premiering in April 2015, &ldquo;Hide Away&rdquo; shot to the top 10 on Billboard&rsquo;s Pop Digital Songs chart and reached #23 on the Billboard Hot 100, with Daya landing on Rolling Stone&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;10 New Artists You Need to Know&rdquo; the following January. With&nbsp;<em>Sit Still, Look Pretty&nbsp;<\/em>arriving in October 2016, Daya soon found her full-length debut climbing to the top 40 on the US Billboard 200 and achieved colossal success with &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Let Me Down&rdquo; (winner of the Best Dance Recording prize at the 2017 Grammys).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each track on Daya&rsquo;s new album comes with a raw emotional charge partly inspired by her love of artists like Amy Winehouse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to very strong female voices&mdash;singers who have something say and keep their music honest,&rdquo; she says. In the making of her new album, Daya spent much of her time reflecting on the growth she&rsquo;s undergone in recent years. &ldquo;When I started out, people seemed to treat me as a young female artist who didn&rsquo;t really have a voice of her own,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It took me a while to speak up for myself, but now I&rsquo;m at the point where I&rsquo;m finally taking the creative reins.&rdquo; And with empowerment more vital to her message than ever, Daya hopes that newfound confidence might help to inspire others. &ldquo;Self-love, self-respect&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you can really be taught those things, but it&rsquo;s important to me to talk about my experience of being a young woman in a male-dominated world,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My hope is that people see the changes that I&rsquo;ve made for myself, and maybe feel more motivated about going out and getting whatever it is that they want for their own lives.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Daya_4_50_33_PM_3_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theofficialdaya"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/daya\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6Dd3NScHWwnW6obMFbl1BH"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/daya"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.theofficialdaya.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DayaOfficialVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/04\/2019 10:22:43 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chaka-khan":{"id":"4983","name":"Chaka Khan","friendly_url":"chaka-khan","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>Chaka Khan is one of the world&rsquo;s most gifted and celebrated musicians, with a rich musical legacy, the 10-time GRAMMY&reg; Award-winner is looking forward to a celebration of a lifetime. A songwriter, actor, author, philanthropist, entrepreneur and activist, Chaka Khan has influenced generations of recording artists. She has the rare ability to sing in seven music genres, including R&amp;B, pop, rock, gospel, country, world music and classical. Affectionately known around the world as Chaka, she is revered by millions of fans as well as her peers for hertimeless, classic and unmatched signature music style and ability. The late, great Miles Davis often said, &ldquo;She [Chaka] sings like my horn.&rdquo; And the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin says, &ldquo;[Chaka] is a one- of- a -kind, premier vocalist.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Throughout her legendary career, Chaka has released 22 albums and racked up ten #1 Billboard magazine charted songs, seven RIAA certified gold singles and ten RIAA certified gold and platinum albums. Chaka&rsquo;s recorded music has produced over 2,000 catalogue song placements. &ldquo;I am honored and blessed to celebrate 40 years in music and entertainment&rdquo; says Chaka. &ldquo;I am so humbled by the love, support and gracious spirit of my fans worldwide and the continuous support my peers have shown over the years. Throughout my 40-year career, I have been through the fire a few times over and I&rsquo;m still here as a living testament to God&rsquo;s love and grace. Next year, I will be celebrating 40 years in the business and 60 years on earth, which equals one hundred percent Chaka.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Early on, she caught the attention of music icon Stevie Wonder, who penned her first smash hit with Rufus, &ldquo;Tell Me Something Good.&rdquo; The single from the group&rsquo;s 1974 platinum-selling album, Rags to Rufus, earned Chaka her first GRAMMY&reg; Award. With Chaka as the group&rsquo;s dynamic center, Rufus became one of the most popular acts around selling out shows throughout the country and dominating the airwaves with hit after hit with songs such as &ldquo;You Got the Love,&rdquo; which Chaka co-wrote, &ldquo;Once You Get Started,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet Thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Everlasting Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do You Love What You Feel?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t Nobody,&rdquo; Chaka&rsquo;s second GRAMMY Award-winning song with Rufus. Rufus and Chaka Khan racked up five RIAA certified gold and platinum albums during their time together.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was inevitable that a singer with Chaka&rsquo;s star power would eventually venture out on her own. In 1978, Chaka blazed onto the music scene as a solo artist with the release of the smash hit &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Every Woman&rdquo; written by Ashford &amp; Simpson. Paired with the late producer extraordinaire, Arif Mardin (Aretha Franklin, Bette Midler), her catalog grew even more impressive with hits such as &ldquo;Clouds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Papillon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What &lsquo;Cha Gonna Do For Me?&rdquo; It was during this time that Chaka began pursuing her love of jazz. She and Arif brilliantly re-worked the classic song &ldquo;Night in Tunisia&rdquo; with the song&rsquo;s originator, Dizzy Gillespie, on trumpet. Chaka also recorded an album of jazz standards titled Echoes of an Era, which featured such luminaries as Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White. Her crowning achievement in jazz was the GRAMMY&reg; Award-winning tune, &ldquo;Be Bop Medley.&rdquo; The song&rsquo;s album, titled Chaka Khan, also won a GRAMMY&reg; for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, the song that made Chaka Khan a household name and propelled her to superstardom the world over was &ldquo;I Feel For You,&rdquo; written and first performed by Prince. This chart-topping, GRAMMY&reg; Award-winning song also made music history. Released in 1984, it was the first R&amp;B song to feature a rap, which was performed by Grandmaster Melle Mel. Chaka also topped the charts with &ldquo;This Is My Night&rdquo; and the instant classic, &ldquo;Through The Fire.&rdquo; Now in top demand, Chaka lent her voice and producer skills to two of the biggest hits of 1986, Steve Winwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Higher Love&rdquo; and Robert Palmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Addicted to Love.&rdquo; Both were GRAMMY&reg;-winning songs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 1995, she made her musical theater debut on London&rsquo;s West End, where she starred in Mama I Want to Sing. In 2002 she traveled to Las Vegas, where she starred in Signed, Sealed Delivered, a critically-acclaimed musical based on the music of Stevie Wonder. Her Broadway debut came in 2008, when she took over the role of Sofia in Oprah Winfrey&rsquo;s musical The Color Purple.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Chaka&rsquo;s emotive vocals can also be heard on a number of soundtracks, including Clockers, Set It Off, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar, Miami Vice, White Knights, Moscow on the Hudson, Disappearing Acts, Waiting to Exhale and Standing In The Shadows Of Motown, as well as Tyler Perry&nbsp;hits Madea&rsquo;s Family Reunion and Meet The Browns.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During her career, she has collaborated with a long list of artists in diverse genres. Collaborators have included Miles Davis, Quincy Jones, Dizzy Gillespie,Stevie Wonder, Prince, Steve Winwood, Mary J. Blige, George Benson, Larry Graham, the London Symphony Orchestra and countless others. Chaka has received a steady stream of accolades for both her artistry and philanthropy. In June, 2012, she was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame, joining previously inducted music greats such as Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Stevie Wonder, Garth Brooks, Bonnie Raitt, George Harrison, B.B. King, Carlos Santana, Donna Summer and Kathleen Battle. In 2011, she was honored for her legendary career with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During the same&nbsp;year, Chaka was honored with the United Negro College Fund&rsquo;s An Evening of Stars Tribute. The program, which was televised on cable networks and broadcast stations in more than 40 cities nationwide, featured tribute performances by Stevie Wonder, Fantasia, Ledisi, El Debarge, Faith Evans, Angie Stone, Ginuwine, Chaka&rsquo;s brother, Mark Stevens, and her daughter, Indira Khan, among others. In recent years,&nbsp;Chaka also received the Soul Train Legend Award (2009), the BET Lifetime Achievement Award (2006), the GRAMMY&reg; Honors Award from the NARAS Chicago Chapter (2006) and the World Music Award Lifetime Achievement Award (2003). In 2004, Chaka received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. Chaka&rsquo;s autobiography, Through the Fire, was published by Rodale Books in 2003 and is currently being adapted into a screenplay.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Despite her busy schedule, Chaka has always made time to support and uplift her community. She has a deep commitment to women and children at risk, which led her to establish the Chaka Khan Foundation in 1999. Initially, the foundation focused primarily on public awareness campaigns around the diagnosis, intervention, and available family resources and the search for a cure for autism. Her efforts were particularly aimed at communities of color and other underserved communities, where awareness about this disorder is low. Her work in this area was inspired by her nephew who has autism and who Chaka describes as &ldquo;gifted and beautiful and so full of life.&rdquo; She later expanded the mission of the foundation to focus more broadly on women and children at risk. In July 2012, Chaka received the McDonald Corporation&rsquo;s 365Black Award, honoring her for her leadership of the Chaka Khan Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Chaka also is an entrepreneur. In 2004, her line of gourmet chocolates, Chakalates, was sold in 20 Neiman Marcus stores around the country. Plans are underway to re-launch her signature brand of chocolates nationally and internationally. She currently is introducing Khana Sutra, a fragrance line for men, women and the home. The line also includes candles, and room and linen sprays. With a new svelte look, a new album, and a great enthusiasm for her new and expanding activities in music, philanthropy and entrepreneurial ventures, the 10-time GRAMMY&reg; Award-winner is looking forward to a celebration of a lifetime.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ChakaKhan_2_11_01_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 2 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 2","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chakakhan\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chakaikhan\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6mQfAAqZGBzIfrmlZCeaYT"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChakaKhan"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/chakakhan.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC00tcG7sRJnw4AGekVp8fPg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/09\/2019 09:36:59 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"styx":{"id":"4933","name":"Styx","friendly_url":"styx","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>The six men comprising Styx have committed to rocking the Paradise together with audiences far and wide by entering their second decade of averaging over 100 shows a year, and each one of them is committed to making the next show better than the last. Styx draws from over four decades of barnburning chart hits, joyous singalongs, and hard-driving deep cuts. Like a symphony that builds to a satisfying crescendo, a Styx set covers a wide range of stylistic cornerstones. From the progressively sweeping splendor that is &ldquo;The Grand Illusion&rdquo; to the hunker-down fortitude of all that is the &ldquo;Blue Collar Man,&rdquo; from the majestic spiritual love for a special &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; to the seething indictment of preening, primping pageantry for pageantry&rsquo;s sake of &ldquo;Miss America,&rdquo; from an individual yearning for true connection as a &ldquo;Man in the Wilderness&rdquo; to a soul-deep quest to achieve what&rsquo;s at the heart of one&rsquo;s personal vision in &ldquo;Crystal Ball,&rdquo; from the regal reach-for-the-stars bravado of &ldquo;Come Sail Away&rdquo; to the grainy all-in gallop of that rugged &ldquo;Renegade&rdquo; who had it made, the band draws on an unlimited cache of ways to immerse one&rsquo;s mind and body in their signature sound.<\/p>\n<p>Styx hit its stride with guitarist\/vocalist Tommy Shaw&rsquo;s first LP with the band, 1976&rsquo;s <em>Crystal Ball<\/em>, and then they become the first group to score four triple-platinum albums in a row: <em>The Grand Illusion<\/em> (1977), <em>Pieces of Eight<\/em> (1978), <em>Cornerstone<\/em> (1979), and <em>Paradise Theater<\/em> (1981). Over the ensuing decade, Styx weathered the shifting winds of the public&rsquo;s musical taste, reconvening for a highly successful 1996 <em>Return to Paradise<\/em> tour that was expertly documented on both CD and DVD in 1997. With a little help from their many friends in Cleveland&rsquo;s Contemporary Youth Orchestra, <em>One With Everything<\/em> (2006) became a hybrid orchestral rock blend for the ages. And on <em>The Grand Illusion \/ Pieces of Eight Live<\/em> (2011), the band performed at its peak when tackling every track from a pair of their finest triple-platinum albums back to back. Not only that, but the band re-recorded two discs&rsquo; worth of its classic material with much finesse and musculature, aptly known as <em>Regeneration Volume I &amp; II<\/em> (2011 &amp; 2012). Observes Tommy, &ldquo;Now you have something you can take home with you and go, &lsquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the band I saw last night.&rsquo; &rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After more than a decade together on the road, this incarnation of Styx is looking forward to performing as many shows as it can as long as it can. &ldquo;It all comes back to the chemistry,&rdquo; says bassist\/vocalist Ricky Phillips. &ldquo;The legacy of this band will be that it brought joy to millions of people,&rdquo; notes drummer Todd Sucherman. Observes keyboardist\/vocalist Lawrence Gowan, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always tried to explain why this is this happening. It&rsquo;s obviously a multitude of factors, but the main one is that our show is <em>really good<\/em>! And if it&rsquo;s really good, they&rsquo;re going to come to see it again.&rdquo; Styx hopes it&rsquo;s a wave that never crests. &ldquo;Every night, we go on that magic carpet ride together,&rdquo; observes original bassist Chuck Panozzo, who joins the band on tour as often as he can. &ldquo;Music is this amazing force that comes from a higher place. I'm humbled for this band to have the great success that it has,&rdquo; says co-founding guitarist\/vocalist James &ldquo;JY&rdquo; Young. &ldquo;We just want to keep on doing this,&rdquo; asserts Tommy. &ldquo;We want to let life take its course and let this music continue to be the soundtrack to it. And this band will continue to evolve as long as we live and play this music.&rdquo; The jig is up, the news is out: The Esprit de Styx is alive and well, and now it&rsquo;s time to see for yourself.

Columbia U.S. released the album in Nov. 1980, which went on to sell more than 2 million albums in the States and four million worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Soon the band found themselves playing on mega tours with Journey, Bob Seger, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, Kansas and Def Leppard, to name a few. They quickly became MTV darlings, being one of the first bands ever featured on the music channel.<\/p>\n<p>With their trademark red leather pants, bandannas, big rock sound and high-energy live shows, LOVERBOY has sold more than 10 million albums, earning four multi-platinum plaques, including the four-million-selling Get Lucky, and a trio of double-platinum releases in their self-titled 1980 debut, 1983&rsquo;s Keep It Up and 1985&rsquo;s Lovin&rsquo; Every Minute of It. Their string of hits includes, in addition to the anthem &ldquo;Working for the Weekend,&rdquo; such arena rock staples as &ldquo;Lovin&rsquo; Every Minute of It,&rdquo; &ldquo;This Could Be the Night,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hot Girls in Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Kid is Hot Tonite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Notorious&rdquo;, &ldquo;Turn Me Loose,&rdquo; &ldquo;When It&rsquo;s Over,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heaven In Your Eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Queen of the Broken Hearts.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>LOVERBOY went on to win a still-record six Juno awards in 1982, and until a three-year sabbatical in 1989, were one of the Top 5 grossing touring acts in the world, performing in over 100 cities across the U.S. and Canada. Their success made them the first Canadian group ever to earn Columbia Records&rsquo; exclusive Crystal Globe Award, celebrating the sale of over five million albums outside their native country. Since 1992, the band has maintained a steady road presence, with Sony\/Legacy releasing a greatest hits compilation, LOVERBOY &ndash; CLASSICS, in 1993, which went gold five years later. In 2001, the band released a live greatest hits CD, Live, Loud &amp; Loose, which captured the group doing what they do best, entertaining their legion of rabid fans.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, LOVERBOY celebrated 25 years together by performing in selected cities throughout the U.S. and Canada. During the summer tour, the band introduced a couple of brand-new songs, which led to Just Getting Started, their first new studio album in a decade. In March 2009, the group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall Of Fame at the Juno Awards show at GM Place in Vancouver, BC, where they joined the likes of Bryan Adams, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and David Foster.<\/p>\n<p>Along with Reno and Dean, LOVERBOY still includes original members Doug Johnson on keyboards and Matt Frenette on drums, with Ken &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; Sinnaeve (a former member of Dean and Frenette&rsquo;s pre-LOVERBOY band Streetheart), replacing the late Scott Smith on bass, and continues a healthy touring schedule around the world.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being in a band is kind of like being on a team,&rdquo; says Reno. &ldquo;Everywhere we go, we try to make it look and sound good.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Unfinished Business is the latest Loverboy album released in 2014. The title came from Dean&rsquo;s idea to involve the band&rsquo;s fans in choosing the name of the album in a popular vote on Facebook, where the choices were first winnowed down to 10 and then opened up to Loverboy&rsquo;s followers, who chose Unfinished Business, giving it the most &ldquo;likes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We put the song titles up and explained that this album was 40 years in the making,&rdquo; says Dean. &ldquo;It was a fun thing. Some of the titles they came up with were hilarious, but maybe a little inappropriate for Wal-Mart.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>More recently, Loverboy has released a trio of singles. These include 2016&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hurtin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Some Like It Hot,&rdquo; as well as 2017&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stop the Rain.&rdquo; In February of 2017, Dean caught national attention when he announced an opportunity for fans to create the official &ldquo;Stop the Rain&rdquo; music video and win one of his own signed guitars. After many submissions, the band chose David Napolillo&rsquo;s video, and Paul revealed his affinity for science fiction by thanking him for &ldquo;Abducting Loverboy into the &lsquo;Alien Hall of Fame.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Their pop culture credibility was cemented by a recent 30 Rock episode in which Scott Adsit&rsquo;s amateur musician Pete Hornberger amusingly revealed he was actually Loverboy&rsquo;s original bassist, showing him inserted into vintage &lsquo;80s footage of the band wailing away on &ldquo;Working for the Weekend.&rdquo; The song is also known as the soundtrack for a memorable Saturday Night Live skit in which Chris Farley and Patrick Swayze played Chippendales dancers who performed to it at an audition.<\/p>\n<p>Loverboy caught corporate America&rsquo;s eye, first with Radio Shack&rsquo;s Super Bowl commercial in which &ldquo;The &lsquo;80s called&hellip; they want their store back,&rdquo; and some of that decade&rsquo;s most popular groups take over the retailer, set over a soundtrack of Loverboy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Working for the Weekend.&rdquo; CNN praised the spot, calling it &ldquo;pure commercial genius&hellip; a spot-on piece of creativity,&rdquo; crediting it with &ldquo;saving a lame&rdquo; game.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the widely-seen Taco Bell spot promoting their breakfast waffle taco, which features a prominent mention of a consumer, &ldquo;Taking down his Loverboy poster&rdquo; as part of an unabashed pitch to those who grew up in the &lsquo;80s and are now smack in the middle of the desired advertising demo.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Loverboy appeared in Enterprise&rsquo;s National Car Rental commercial with Patrick Warburton (Seinfeld character, David Puddy) who jokingly admits his hardcore affinity for the band by stating that he was &ldquo;President of the Loverboy-Lover&rsquo;s Club &ndash; California Chapter.&rdquo; The commercial was seen by millions when it kicked off Sunday Night Football for the NFL&rsquo;s 2016-17 season.<\/p>\n<p>But it is LOVERBOY&rsquo;s reputation as a live act which has always been its calling card, as the group continues to entertain fans of all ages, amazing even Mike Reno.<\/p>\n<p>\"Something's in the water,\" he says. &ldquo;I go to these concerts expecting there to be 3,000 people, and there's seven or eight thousand people! And most of them are young! Even kiddies, like 10 years old. They even know all the words. It's freaking me out.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I look at our concerts as a 100-minute experience,&rdquo; says Dean, who laughingly still claims to be able to fit into the same pair of red leather pants he wore on the &ldquo;Lucky Ones&rdquo; video in 1982. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a normal guy up until 10 minutes before we hit the stage. Then the heart rate goes up and I consciously step into the bubble. And I don&rsquo;t come out of it until 30 minutes after that last cymbal smash and we walk off-stage. It&rsquo;s a great stress release, even better than riding a Harley!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Loverboy and Rick Springfield toured together which culminated in a sold out show at L.A.&rsquo;s iconic Greek Theater. Additionally, Loverboy&rsquo;s 2017 tour includes headlining events such as the United States&rsquo; M3 Rock Festival, Canada&rsquo;s CannaFest, and the UK&rsquo;s Rockingham Festival.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When we do live shows these days, I notice the songs have come to a better place,&rdquo; says Reno. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing them a little differently, but the catalyst is still the same. We live these songs&mdash;they&rsquo;re part of our DNA, and they&rsquo;re part of a lot of people&rsquo;s DNA. They send us a lot of love and we end up loving them back, so it&rsquo;s just a big love-fest, really.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the band&rsquo;s most famous song is &ldquo;Working for the Weekend,&rdquo; which has fueled a generation&rsquo;s dreams of toiling every day for the chance to celebrate come Friday night. Dean realizes it has taken on a whole new meaning these days.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky if you <em>can<\/em> work for the weekend now,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all fortunate to be doing that. My personal dream has always been to play guitar and entertain people,&rdquo; he enthuses. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no feeling like looking out in the audience and seeing them grinning ear to ear, everyone on the same wavelength. And once we start with the mega-hits, the place goes crazy. That&rsquo;s why we do what we do and will continue.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Loverboy_5_01_40_PM_3_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Loverboy"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/loverboyband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TnHm4ro_l8s"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2CLVPk9FcywjClBcTvWPkT"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/loverboyband"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/06\/2019 03:40:38 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"frenship":{"id":"5102","name":"Frenship","friendly_url":"frenship","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>L.A. duo FRENSHIP&rsquo;s (James Sunderland and Brett Hite) new single &ldquo;Love Somebody&rdquo; follows up the duo&rsquo;s 2016 mega-hit &ldquo;Capsize&rdquo; and last fall&rsquo;s acclaimed EP Truce with seemingly effortless flair. As grateful as they were for breaking though, the band was careful to leave their monster streaming, radio, and touring success at the door when they ventured out to Ojai, CA to begin writing sessions for what would eventually become their evocative new single.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We had just come off the road this spring and the impact of &lsquo;Capsize&rsquo; was still resonating, but we weren&rsquo;t sitting around saying &lsquo;Oh, we have to top what came before,&rsquo;&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;We just want to keep putting out music and hope that our songs connect so that we can keep building.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>FRENSHIP&rsquo;s foundation is alive and well thanks to the impressionistic &ldquo;Love Somebody.&rdquo; The duo&rsquo;s flinty chemistry depends on their ability to converge and diverge at any point in a song&rsquo;s construction to get to its core. They resist cookie-cutter solutions for a kind of against-the-grain truth-meter that breaks form and embraces their own creative distinctions. For James, the song began as an ode to an ex-lover he wanted to send off with a heartfelt song. &ldquo;Kind of saying it didn&rsquo;t work out but I hope you find happiness with somebody else. It&rsquo;s like the goodbye song I never wrote.&rdquo; For Brett, it conjured up an outlook on life and love he wishes for people even at their very youngest. &ldquo;My nephew was 1 year old at the time we wrote it, and I remember thinking the song could be ascribed for what I hope for him &ndash; to feel joy, to feel pain, to experience all that life has to offer and at the end of the day to love and be loved by somebody.&rdquo; The end result is a mood-altering gem with a strong chorus that can&rsquo;t help but stick in your head. &ldquo;I like the fact that it invites different interpretations,&rdquo; says Brett. &ldquo;The best songs are always perceived one way by one person and a completely different way by somebody else. When we write, the binding thing in the end is that it means something to us both.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The same kind of vetting took place on their massive hit &ldquo;Capsize.&rdquo; The viral impact of the infectious song (featuring Emily Warren) marked it as a rare difference-maker in the world of hybrid pop. &ldquo;Capsize&rdquo; totaled nearly 410 million streams, scoring at radio and notching multiple gold and platinum certifications around the world. Frenship earned the #2 Breakout Artist nod for 2016 on Spotify and a Shazam 2017 Emerging Artist tout, with the group becoming an in-demand breakthrough act at concerts and festivals around the globe, including Lollapalooza Chicago, Outside Lands Music Festival, Life Is Beautiful and others. They drew raves opening for British indie band Bastille on their European and U.S. treks, also establishing themselves as a deserving headlining act.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We enjoy playing live and kind of keep focused on show concerns when we&rsquo;re out there, leaving the songwriting for when we&rsquo;re off the road,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we went to Ojai when we were all done. It was hiking in the morning and working on new songs the rest of the day.&rdquo; Joined by ------ and previous collaborator Nick Ruth, FRENSHIP worked on about 30 &lsquo;ideas,&rsquo; with &ldquo;Love Somebody&rdquo; revealing itself as the breakaway track from the sessions. The group completed a video with up-and-coming director Austin Kearns, which Brett says they shot in &ldquo;actual film, not video,&rdquo; adding it &ldquo;was fun to do&rdquo; and also felt more authentic. &ldquo;It goes back to the songs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always conscious of trying to make our music a little more timeless. That vibe was definitely there in the writing sessions. We never want to be yesterday&rsquo;s news.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Frenship_4_58_18_PM_3_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 8:30 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"8:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wearefrenship\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wearefrenship\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7xEFii6utZmQ61kX59HmLH"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wearefrenship"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/wearefrenship.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCSU5CHWVMbb5gT97juwkOig"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 11:43:10 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chris-janson":{"id":"4930","name":"Chris Janson","friendly_url":"chris-janson","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p>Chris Janson is Platinum-selling high octane entertainer, multi-instrumentalist, award-winning singer\/songwriter, and the youngest living member of the Grand Ole Opry.

Josef Salvat)&rdquo; shot to #1 on Spotify&rsquo;s US and Global Viral charts, while &ldquo;Whole Heart&rdquo; (a collaboration with Bipolar Sunshine) hit #2 on Spotify&rsquo;s New Music Friday playlist. Also known for turning out several of the biggest remixes in recent years&mdash;including his masterly reworkings of Tove Lo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Talking Body,&rdquo; CHVRCHES&rsquo; &ldquo;Clearest Blue,&rdquo; and Years &amp; Years&rsquo; &ldquo;Desire&rdquo;&mdash;Gryffin is now offering up his latest original track and bringing his boundary-shattering artistry to bold new heights.<\/p>\n<p>Emotionally charged and irresistibly high-energy, the aptly named &ldquo;Feel Good&rdquo; is powered by hypnotic melody, massive beats, and a magnetic vocal performance from singer\/songwriter Daya. Fresh off her Grammy Award win for &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Let Me Down&rdquo; (the multi-platinum smash that earned 2017&rsquo;s Best Dance Recording prize), Daya lends her soulful vocals to Gryffin&rsquo;s immaculate arrangement of heavy synth and delicate guitar work. In crafting that arrangement, Gryffin drew equally from his edgy ingenuity as a producer and his carefully honed musicality as a longtime guitarist and classically trained pianist.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The lyrics that Daya came up with had so much intensity to them&mdash;writing about that significant other in your life who puts you in a positive, happy state of mind, even when bad things may be happening in your life or in the world. I wanted the production to reflect that intensity, but at the same time create a really positive vibe,&rdquo; explains Dan Griffith, who&rsquo;s made music under the name Gryffin since 2014. &ldquo;My goal with the song was to find that balance, and I ended up hitting it by adding a lot of synth sounds I&rsquo;d never used before, and by bringing in different guitar textures and then flipping them in a new way. That&rsquo;s what the Gryffin project is about overall: making electronic music but using real guitar and real piano so that there&rsquo;s this organic feeling to every song.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Originally from the San Francisco area, Gryffin began his musical journey by taking up piano at age seven. In high school he added guitar to his repertoire in addition to writing his own music for the first time. While studying electrical engineering at University of Southern California, Gryffin broadened his sonic palette by diving into the world of electronic music and teaching himself production with a downloaded copy of Ableton. &ldquo;I got started during a really exciting time for electronic music&mdash;I remember thinking I&rsquo;d never heard sounds like that before,&rdquo; recalls Griffith, who lists the early work of artists like Skrillex and Avicii among his first influences. &ldquo;It all felt so fresh and new to me, and I wanted to see if I could make music like that too.\"<\/p>\n<p>Toward the end of his studies at USC, Griffith started posting his original productions online and soon gained attention for his inventive sensibilities. One of his earliest releases, a 2014 remix of Ellie Goulding&rsquo;s &ldquo;Burn&rdquo; was hailed by EDM Tunes for &ldquo;evok[ing] a cosmic, almost transcendental ambience with an electric guitar backdrop and airy vocal splices,&rdquo; and quickly expanded his online following. &ldquo;That remix was the first time I&rsquo;d used guitar in a dance music production,&rdquo; notes Gryffin. &ldquo;All of a sudden I had all these producers messaging me to ask how I did it, which was the moment when I realized that maybe this was a direction I should keep pursuing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As he sharpened his production skills and refined his vision, Gryffin pushed forward with releasing highly acclaimed remixes (including his 2014 take on Maroon 5&rsquo;s &ldquo;Animals,&rdquo; which would eventually catch the attention of Interscope Records and lead to his signing). In late 2015 he made his stage debut at the SnowGlobe Music Festival, unveiling a dynamic performance that deftly introduced live instrumentation into the dance music format. With &ldquo;Heading Home&rdquo; arriving in early 2016&mdash;and accumulating a million plays within just a week of its release via Darkroom\/Interscope Records&mdash;Gryffin next embarked on his sold-out Heading Home Tour and later played major summer festivals like Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, and Firefly. Released in August, &ldquo;Whole Heart&rdquo; racked up more than 35 million streams on Spotify and served as the launching point for Gryffin&rsquo;s biggest tour to date: the Whole Heart Live Tour, a fall 2016 trek that spanned North America.<\/p>\n<p>With a highly-buzzed about set at Coachella both weekends this year and upcoming performances at A-list festivals like Lollapalooza and Governor&rsquo;s Ball 2017, Gryffin thrives on creating an unforgettable stage show that blurs the line between electronic music and raw live performance. Further proving the vitality of his music, several artists have taken to performing Gryffin&rsquo;s versions of their own songs when playing live. And with his name referencing the mythical half-lion\/half-eagle creature and its power to soar, Gryffin aims to continue instilling a potent, uplifting energy into each of his tracks. &ldquo;Part of the reason I like working with piano and guitar so much is that it adds a human element that can&rsquo;t be replicated&mdash;you might not even realize it as a listener, but you feel it on some deeper level,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It builds this connection that&rsquo;s really powerful, and to me that ability to make music that moves people and picks them up is the most rewarding thing in the world.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Gryffin_11_00_41_AM_3_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 10:15 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"10:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gryffinofficial"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gryffinofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2ZRQcIgzPCVaT9XKhXZIzh"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gryffinofficial"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/gryffinofficial.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/23\/2019 03:29:52 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dispatch":{"id":"4989","name":"Dispatch","friendly_url":"dispatch","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Dispatch, the upbeat rock band that&rsquo;s heralded as one of the biggest independent bands in history, is in the middle of one of their most prolific periods to date. Following the release of last year&rsquo;s massively successful album America, Location 12, the trio went back out to Northern California: Stinson Beach&rsquo;s Panoramic House, to wrap up some recording that they didn&rsquo;t finish the first time around. This new collection of music is Location 13 and features the single &ldquo;Letter to Lady J&rdquo; - it finds the band pushing boundaries and breaking new ground, welcoming old fans and new audiences alike by building new classics and reaching new heights. It's impossible to deny that few bands &ndash; at any level &ndash; have been able to achieve what Dispatch has: three soldout shows at Madison Square Garden to raise funds for Zimbabwean humanitarian efforts, world tours and a concert in Boston that drew 110,000 fans. They&rsquo;ve been known, since the band's inception, as being more than just about the music &ndash; they've constantly directed their energy to causes and campaigns along the way. Dispatch is going ahead into this new era with both the passion and vigor of a band in their infancy and the knowledge and power of one together for 20 years and counting. In a world where hope is in short supply, fear runs rampant and alternative facts blare louder than the truth, we need, more than ever, music that is honest. Dispatch is rising to the occasion by creating music that is vital to their fans and beyond.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Dispatch_10_38_44_AM_3_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 7 - 9:30 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 7","start_time":"9:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dispatchmusic\/"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/dispatchmusic.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dispatchmusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DISPATCHMUSIC"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dispatchmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6v4jPZO3UIDNJIgdxRxtr9"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/27\/2019 07:54:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"skillet":{"id":"4950","name":"Skillet","friendly_url":"skillet","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Skillet lets their music speak the loudest. That&rsquo;s how the quartet has cemented its place as one of the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century&rsquo;s most successful rock bands. Selling over 11 million units worldwide, the Wisconsin quartet&mdash;John Cooper [lead vocals\/bass], Korey Cooper [guitar\/keys], Jen Ledger [drums\/vocals], and Seth Morrison [lead guitars]&mdash;have received two GRAMMY&reg; Award nominations and won a <em>Billboard <\/em>Music Award for the platinum-certified <em>Awake<\/em>. Their double-platinum single &ldquo;Monster&rdquo; is &ldquo;the eighth most- streamed rock song of 2015&rdquo; with a total of 57 million plays (and counting) on Spotify and would earn the distinction of becoming &ldquo;the best-selling digital single in the history of Christian Music.&rdquo; 2013&rsquo;s <em>Rise <\/em>bowed at #4 on the <em>Billboard <\/em>Top 200 upon release and received resounding and eclectic acclaim from the likes of <em>USA Today<\/em>, <em>New York Times<\/em>, <em>Revolver Loudwire<\/em>, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The group&rsquo;s ninth full-length album, <em>UNLEASHED <\/em>[Atlantic Records\/Word], sees them turn everything up louder, amplifying all aspects of their signature hypnotic sound. Channeling an intense muse, John immediately commenced writing just months after <em>Rise <\/em>hit shelves.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;By the time <em>Rise <\/em>came out, I could take a little bit of a breather and experience it,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;I remember thinking, &lsquo;this feels important to me, but I need something a little more urgent.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t want whatever we did next to be so emotionally heavy. I wanted to make a record that made people feel the music &ndash; an album that would connect people to the music as well as to each other. An album, like some of my favorites, that&rsquo;d be like a party to listen to &ndash; where people could sing along - together.<\/p>\n<p>That idea solidified as Skillet toured Europe in 2013 with Nickelback. Night after night, John watched the non-English speaking audience sing every word back to him. It left an indelible mark on his writing process.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It struck me, how music is much bigger than a language,&rdquo; he affirms. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a universal feeling. We wanted to get that emotion across more through the music than with the words. I aimed to write songs people could easily relate to anywhere and everywhere.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Getting off the road in 2015, John headed to Los Angeles to begin recording what would become <em>UNLEASHED <\/em>with producer Brian Howes&mdash;who helmed the 2006 platinum- selling <em>Comatose <\/em>and co-wrote the platinum No. 1 smash &ldquo;Awake and Alive.&rdquo; Cutting half of the album with Brian, John tapped the talents of multiple producers for the first<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>time in Skillet history, working with both GRAMMY Award winning producer Seth Mosley in Nashville and Kevin Churko [Five Finger Death Punch, Ozzy Osbourne, Disturbed] in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Comatose <\/em>was a very special album for a lot of reasons,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;We wanted to record with Brian again and when the chance came up we were both ready to go. I&rsquo;m also a huge fan of Kevin Churko, and it was amazing to have the opportunity to write with him. When I met Seth we just clicked. The entire process with each of them was such a great experience.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The first single &ldquo;Feel Invincible&rdquo; explodes to life on a swinging guitar chug transitioning to sweeping electronics and a theatrical vocal call-and-response. Everything culminates on a towering chant that&rsquo;s impossible to shake just as a melodic guitar lead takes off.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fight song,&rdquo; says John. &ldquo;Sometimes, everything in the world makes you want to give up. This is a reminder not to. I think, &lsquo;This is my life. This is my family. I can&rsquo;t go around being scared all the time.&rsquo; I have the strength to face what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, &ldquo;Stars&rdquo; shines with a passionate and poetic refrain, &ldquo;Here I am, lifting up my heart to the one who holds the stars.&rdquo; Amidst the shimmering electronics and orchestration, it carries a message that John hopes will be easy to understand.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It goes along with wanting to speak to as many people as possible,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;On a deeper spiritual level, for those who may not believe, it&rsquo;s saying that there&rsquo;s something bigger out there&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s your community, family, or friends. Basically that we&rsquo;re not, and don&rsquo;t have to be alone.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the snapping crunch of &ldquo;Burn it Down&rdquo; or the skittering crash and burn on &ldquo;Out of Hell,&rdquo; the record exudes a propulsive energy that can speak to both sides of the band&rsquo;s audience, whether they&rsquo;re sharing a bill with Disturbed or Lecrae.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an amazing journey,&rdquo; John leaves off. &ldquo;The fans, the Panheads, means everything to us. They&rsquo;re the reason we&rsquo;re here. They make our shows what they are. We wanted to give that energy back to them in <em>UNLEASHED<\/em>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, this is Skillet at their most potent, pure, and powerful.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Skillet_3_01_53_PM_3_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/skillet"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.skillet.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/skilletmusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/skilletband"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/skilletmusic\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/49bzE5vRBRIota4qeHtQM8"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 09:35:42 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chase-rice":{"id":"5048","name":"Chase Rice","friendly_url":"chase-rice","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p><strong>&ldquo;The only formula is putting out good music,&rdquo; says Chase Rice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as simple as that. I&rsquo;m not letting anyone or anything get in the way of that anymore.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rice released his ten-song album <strong><em>Lambs &amp; Lions <\/em><\/strong>late last year with new label partner BBR Music Group \/ BMG&mdash;the follow-up to 2014&rsquo;s <em>Ignite the Night<\/em>, which hit No. 1 on the country charts and reached the top five of the all-genre Billboard 200&mdash;but with <em>Lambs &amp; Lions<\/em>, he is making a fresh start. With a new label and a renewed sense of creative purpose, he is making music that draws from multiple sources and influences, but is unified by his vision, integrity, and honesty.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is an album that stands for what I stand for,&rdquo; says Rice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of myself as a country artist specifically&mdash;I&rsquo;m here to be an artist, period. I&rsquo;m very proud of the country genre, and I think we have some big country radio songs on here, but outside of that, there&rsquo;s a story I wanted to tell, regardless of genre. I had to completely put out of my mind what anyone else would think. I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied until I took it as far as I possibly could.<\/p>\n<p>The ten songs on <em>Lambs &amp; Lions <\/em>derive from Rice&rsquo;s life and experience, triumphs and disappointments, and ultimately his determination to stand up for his convictions. Produced by Chris DeStefano, Mac MacAnally and, most surprisingly, Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Cold War Kids), <em>Lambs &amp; Lions <\/em>offers up sounds from the unsettling strings and horns on the title track to the spare piano and swelling choir of &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; And if it took him walking out on his record company and finding a new home to get there, it also reflects the unconventional path that led him to make music in the first place.<\/p>\n<p><em>That tobacco town where I grew up The tailgate down on a jacked-up truck<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>A ring we earned 'cause we owned that state A tombstone with my daddy's name&hellip;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>And I need someone to remind me who I am Oh, Carolina can<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash;&ldquo;Carolina Can&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Born in Florida and raised on a farm in Asheville, North Carolina, Rice was a promising linebacker at the University of North Carolina. &ldquo;Football wired me for the rest of my life,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;including in some wrong ways. So, I&rsquo;ve had to learn to be more sensitive and when to be more aggressive. It&rsquo;s a focus you carry on to everything you do in life.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Encouraged by his father, he began playing guitar and writing songs in college. After his father died and an injury ended his football career, music became his solace during a period of depression. (The slogan he took to writing inside the brim of his baseball caps, \"HDEU,\" served as a reminder to keep his head down, working, but his eyes up, looking forward to the future&mdash;and now inspires his clothing company, Head Down Eyes Up.)<\/p>\n<p>After college, Rice was selected as a NASCAR pit crew member, winning two championships with Hendrick Motorsports, and then took time away to escape and became a contestant on <em>Survivor: Nicaragua. <\/em>But his heart never left music, and he knew he had to take his shot at Nashville. Soon after arriving, he was part of the team that wrote Florida Georgia Line&rsquo;s Diamond-certified smash &ldquo;Cruise.&rdquo; After a couple independent album releases of his own, Rice signed a major label deal.<\/p>\n<p>It was the peak moment for country songs about girls, trucks, and parties, and the <em>Ignite the Night <\/em>album spun off several hit singles, including the Platinum-certified &ldquo;Ready Set Roll&rdquo; and Gold &ldquo;Gonna Wanna Tonight.&rdquo; Rice still feels connected to this earlier work. &ldquo;I can still completely relate to those songs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still proud of that record. It got people to come to the shows, put me on a farm I otherwise would never have, and made me into the artist I am today.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He points to the song &ldquo;Carolina Can&rdquo; as a breakthrough for him personally with his writing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare to have a song that&rsquo;s so truthful,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The title is one state, one place&mdash;it tells my story&mdash;but anybody can relate to feeling and sentiment. It&rsquo;s just a huge honor to have a song like that in our arsenal when we take the stage.&rdquo; It would be a turning point not just in his songwriting, but in his goals and ambitions.<\/p>\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s the soundtrack to our lives It&rsquo;s the only reason why<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>A kid from Carolina would drive to Nashville to chase a dream without a dime&hellip; For a second we&rsquo;re bullet proof<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>We get lost in a song or two<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The world don&rsquo;t move, and all I need is you and three chords and the truth<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash;&ldquo;Three Chords &amp; The Truth&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>After one frustrating conversation with an executive, Rice went home, called his team, and informed them that he wanted out of his deal. &ldquo;The more shows I kept playing, the more I learned that what I really needed was to get a record out,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So I put my foot down and when I found that the label didn&rsquo;t have the same plan as I did, I just said, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s go our separate ways&rsquo;&mdash;and I have zero problem with that. I was confident about that decision, and I believed in the album I was making. Looking back at that period I realize now that it was really about me needing to bet on myself before expecting others to do that as well.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>One song he believed in was &ldquo;Three Chords &amp; The Truth,&rdquo; a tribute to the power of discovering the songs&mdash;&ldquo;Amazing Grace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet Home Alabama,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mama Tried,&rdquo;&mdash;that changed his life. &ldquo;I had actually wanted that to be the next single after &lsquo;Gonna Wanna Tonight,&rsquo;&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s personal as it details going back to high school and what it meant to me to hear those songs for the first time.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He kept writing for an album that he hoped would be out more than a year ago. &ldquo;It was a long, <em>long <\/em>process,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But some of my favorite songs wouldn&rsquo;t have been on here if I hadn&rsquo;t kept going. It didn&rsquo;t change completely, but it gave me time to analyze and make the songs better.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Born and bred to be dangerous We might roar<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>On a Saturday night get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Well there's lambs and there's lions<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash;&ldquo;Lions&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Enter Broken Bow Records, home of Jason Aldean and Dustin Lynch, which decided to give Rice and <em>Lambs &amp; Lions <\/em>a chance. &ldquo;I had all these songs, and I knew I wanted to tell a story, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure <em>what <\/em>that was,&rdquo; says Rice. &ldquo;I wanted each song to have its own identity, and it would fill the album with what it needed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But he felt sure that a song called &ldquo;Lions&rdquo; would be the title track. &ldquo;I wanted to write something you would listen to in the locker room before you go out and crush it on the football field,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It means even more to me now because I had to weather a lot of storms, fight for my career&mdash;and see how much it motivates me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <em>Lambs &amp; Lions <\/em>draws on pop (the irresistible hooks of &ldquo;Eyes on You&rdquo;), rock, even old- school country sounds, ending with Rice&rsquo;s version of iconic singer and rodeo champion Chris<\/p>\n<p>LeDoux's \"This Cowboy's Hat,\" performed with LeDoux's son Ned. &ldquo;The lines between genres are getting thinner and thinner&mdash;that&rsquo;s the world we live in,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So I decided even more not to pander to what anybody wants me to do. The only way to make it successful is to make it true to me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Chase Rice points to a number of other artists as inspirations&mdash;Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, Eric Church, Bruce Springsteen, Darius Rucker (&ldquo;My God, he changed completely!&rdquo;). But he says that he holds no single musician as a role model. &ldquo;Every artist needs to figure out their own way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are so many right ways to do it. The best way is just to be yourself and be good to people. I think you do that and you&rsquo;ll be alright.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ChaseRice_2_44_03_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChaseRiceMusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chaserice\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6pBNfggcZZDCmb0p92OnGn"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chasericemusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.chaserice.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/OfficialChaseRice"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/29\/2019 04:49:45 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"august-burns-red":{"id":"5030","name":"August Burns Red","friendly_url":"august-burns-red","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>Every time August Burns Red record an album, the GRAMMY&reg; Award-nominated Pennsylvania quintet&mdash;John &ldquo;JB&rdquo; Brubaker [lead guitar], Brent Rambler [rhythm guitar], Matt Greiner [drums], Jake Luhrs [lead vocals], and Dustin Davidson [bass]&mdash;push themselves harder, raze expectations, and reach a new level.

But like it or not, those in our bloodlines are stuck with us&mdash;and us with them&mdash;for better or for worse. Paul Janeway understands this conundrum of heritage well. The singer of the Birmingham, Alabama&ndash;based rock and roll soul band St. Paul &amp; The Broken Bones was born and raised in America&rsquo;s Deep South, a place where social consciousness can still take a backseat to unsavory traditions and where a family&rsquo;s expectations sometimes supersede all else. Despite the fierce familial love, he enjoyed and constantly gave back while growing up&mdash;especially to his father and grandfather&mdash;from an early age Janeway realized that the way he thought about the world was a little different from those around him, and he began to seek an outlet from which to share what was in his heart and on his mind. Blessed with a powerful voice, a magnetism for connecting with people, and a gift for making music, he traded in a career in ministry to start his own band.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been the artsy weirdo in the family,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m liberal, a blue dot in a very red part of the world. When you&rsquo;re from Alabama you have to go out of your way to make people understand that you think a little differently. But we&rsquo;re an Alabama band&mdash;it&rsquo;s who we are.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>St. Paul &amp; The Broken Bones formed in 2012, releasing their debut album <em>Half the City<\/em> in 2014 and its follow up, 2016&rsquo;s <em>Sea of Noise<\/em>, too much acclaim. Those strong efforts helped place them on the national scene, and the band worked hard to prove they were no mere retro-soul band&mdash;from touring the world relentlessly, including being selected to open for The Rolling Stones and headlining two nights at the Ryman Auditorium, to TV appearances including <em>The Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Conan, Austin City Limits <\/em>two appearances on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,<\/em> one being the very first episode. Janeway&rsquo;s fearless showmanship, thoughtful lyrics, and dedication to his performance soon became the band&rsquo;s calling card, and paired with the inventive and skillful direction of co-band leader Jesse Phillips as well as a full eight-man roster comprised of some of the best young instrumentalists in the South, they soon became a must-see event. (In addition to Janeway on lead vocals and Phillips on bass and guitar, the lineup is rounded out by Browan Lollar (guitars), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keyboards), Allen Branstetter (trumpet), Chad Fisher (trombone) and Amari Ansari (saxophone), who replaced Jason Mingledorff following the album&rsquo;s recording) Over time, Janeway has learned the art of balancing expectations and how to reconcile his past with his future, just as his band have learned how to overcome their perception by pushing against its ceiling. In embracing those things he cannot change, he has forged ahead as an artist and as a man. And with his band&rsquo;s new album, <em>Young Sick Camellia<\/em>, Janeway has created a space for St. Paul &amp; The Broken Bones to rival any forward-thinking band making music today, based on a concept all-too familiar to him: family, and how we love them despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>Upon completing <em>Sea of Noise<\/em>, Janeway began working on its follow up immediately, with the idea in mind to write directly about his relationship with his father and grandfather. &ldquo;I was dwelling on my family and the complexity to all the men&rsquo;s relationships,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;My papaw was not a warm person, but he showed his affection through hard work. He and my father had a complicated relationship and didn&rsquo;t communicate well. This record is about me growing up in a digital age, and my father and papaw growing up in their different times, and exploring the dynamics of those relationships.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Originally envisioning the project as a trio of EP&rsquo;s, each from the perspective of the three generations of Janeway men, he realized he had enough material in the first volume&mdash;written from his own vantage&mdash;to make a full-length record. Assigning himself the image of a camellia, the Alabama state flower, Janeway uses his lyrics as a conduit for interpersonal conversation and excision, in addition to pieces of an actual conversation with his grandfather he recorded months before his unexpected death. &ldquo;I wanted to explore the dynamics and their views on life,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an extremely personal record&mdash;not that I haven&rsquo;t written personal records before, but this is more in-depth and with a vulnerability that I was maybe scared to try. But you have to have that exposure. I think we&rsquo;re in a much better place than we&rsquo;ve ever been as a band. We weren&rsquo;t totally confident with the &lsquo;retro soul&rsquo; label that was thrust on us and we knew we had to explore more ground. <em>Young Sick Camellia<\/em> is the first record we&rsquo;ve done that just felt right all the way through, like we&rsquo;re doing <em>us<\/em>. Nothing was rushed and everything has intent.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Janeway leaned more heavily than ever before on his band to help with the songwriting. In the past, he and Phillips served as a &ldquo;two-headed monster&rdquo; who ultimately called all the shots; this time around, however, the band was invited to add song ideas. &ldquo;The record really flexes the muscle of this band,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;Musically, it&rsquo;s a kaleidoscope of flavors and it covers a lot of ground.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Furthering this notion, the band chose the hip-hop \/ modern R&amp;B producer Jack Splash to record in Los Angeles, a choice that Janeway credits with taking the band outside of their comfort zone and establishing a connection to a new sound. Fusing the use of samples, fresh rhythms, and new instruments with Janeway&rsquo;s specific interpersonal subject matter, <em>Young Sick Camellia <\/em>is sure to place St. Paul &amp; The Broken Bones in a whole new sphere. From the opening space-opus of &ldquo;Convex&rdquo; to the snappy, buoyant charm of &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo; and the intensely personal bent of &ldquo;LivWithoutU&rdquo; and the album-ending &ldquo;Bruised Fruit,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s clear that this represents a new chapter of the band. As Janeway howls the words &ldquo;Blood is what I can&rsquo;t escape&rdquo; during the final number, the chills are affecting, reminding the listener of the place and circumstances from which the singer and the album come&mdash;especially considering the unexpected passing of a central character, one whose appearance is both heard and felt throughout.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I recorded a conversation some months ago with my papaw, who was in his 80&rsquo;s and had smoked everyday since he was nine,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;I made the decision to use that audio on the record, and then he got sick and passed away a few months later after we had finished the album. It felt like that&rsquo;s why we did this; it&rsquo;s just the way the world works, a beautiful thing. In my mind music lives forever, and that will always be there.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Just as his family makes a grand imprint in the very DNA of <em>Young Sick Camellia<\/em>, Janeway and his band are set to have a lasting impact in today&rsquo;s musical landscape. The album they have created, whether a standalone affair or eventually accompanied by successive parts of a trilogy, challenges the notions of what a soul outfit can be, and establishes their reputation as a band as likely to make you think as to dance. A darker, more cerebral affair, the album embraces a variety of sonic experiments and blurs boundary lines but its focus remains sharply on the titular frontman and his bold, intensely personal and brave examination of his own family tree and how it has shaped him.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;For now, this feels like our opus,&rdquo; Janeway says. &ldquo;But the story doesn&rsquo;t feel finished, so with that, it has to continue. We&rsquo;ve already got music for the next one. What I perceive this to be is different from anything anyone is doing. It&rsquo;s so terrifying and so fun at the same time.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_St.PaulandTheBrokenBones_9_10_50_AM_5_16_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 27 - 9:30 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 27","start_time":"9:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/stpaulandthebrokenbones.com\/"},{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/St.PaulandTheBrokenBones"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stpaulandthebrokenbones\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4fXkvh05wFhuH77MfD4m9o"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StP_BrokenBones"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/04\/2019 09:50:46 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"hanson":{"id":"4939","name":"Hanson","friendly_url":"hanson","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<p>In 2017, the trio of brothers who make up pop-rock trio HANSON are celebrating 25 years of playing music together, selling millions of albums and reaching fans from Tulsa to Tokyo. Doing anything for a quarter century is rare, even more rare when you include global fame at a young age, years of touring, writing and recording, founding an independent label, and balancing brotherhood and business. Consistent with their path thus far, instead of focusing on the improbable nature of their past success, they are only looking back long enough to get inspired for their future.<\/p>\n<p>To celebrate this landmark year, HANSON is launching the &ldquo;<em>Middle Of Everywhere 25<sup>th<\/sup> Anniversary World Tour<\/em>,&rdquo; alongside a new greatest hits collection of the same name, which includes new single &ldquo;I Was Born,&rdquo; infusing a piece of the future into the year&rsquo;s reflective projects.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1992 at ages 11, nine and six, brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zac spent their first five years building a fanbase as an independent band in Tulsa, OK, performing both classic rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll and soul music and their own original material, to form their own unique blend of harmony-driven, soulful pop-rock. This unlikely focus was forged by an early introduction to music from the 1950&rsquo;s and early 60&rsquo;s, with the young brothers citing influences from Aretha Franklin to Otis Redding, The Beatles, Elvis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. These influences formed the bedrock of their musical inspiration, helping to forge their signature sound which incorporated strong melodies and song craft, as well as reverence for their musical forefathers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After five years and two independent albums, HANSON released their major label debut in 1997, and saw a meteoric rise with the international smash single &ldquo;Mmmbop&rdquo; from the album Middle Of Nowhere, which garnered multiple Grammy nominations and five consecutive top 40 singles, including &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s The Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Will Come To You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weird&rdquo;. Continuing the momentum with their critically acclaimed sophomore release <em>This Time Around<\/em>, more hit singles and extensive touring deepened the band&rsquo;s connection with their fans, and helped to cement their place as one of the world&rsquo;s leading artists.<\/p>\n<p>After a record label merger nearly derailed the release of their second album, in 2003 HANSON decided to found their own independent 3CG Records. The decision to form the label was ahead of its time with few high level mainstream artists choosing to self release, but with the new label the band was able to establish stability in a very turbulent music business, starting a new era for themselves. Their first independent release, <em>Underneath<\/em> in 2004, was a #1 Billboard Independent Album, and helped establish HANSON as one of the most successful independent bands to date. Since then HANSON has released 3 more studio albums, <em>The Walk<\/em>, <em>Shout It Out<\/em>, and <em>ANTHEM,<\/em> as well as an ongoing stream of special products and live albums through their label, and toured the world, continuing to focus on cultivating a vibrant global fanbase. The group has sold over 16 million albums to date.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, they launched a grassroots campaign to help combat poverty and provide HIV\/AIDS relief in Africa (TakeTheWalk.net), hosting one-mile barefoot walks with thousands of individuals committed to the cause. In 2013, the group diversified its brand with the founding of their Hanson Brothers Beer Company, and in 2014 established The Hop Jam Beer and Music Festival, based in their hometown of Tulsa, OK, which brings artists and brewers from all over the world to one of the country&rsquo;s leading Craft Beer and Music Festivals with 40,000 in attendance.<\/p>\n<p>HANSON has never been driven by trends or fame, but instead is fueled by the personal drive to create great art, inspire connection and cultivate community. Those qualities are at the root of the band&rsquo;s longevity and lasting connection with fans.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Hanson_9_06_35_AM_5_16_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hansonmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/hanson.net\/home"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hansonmusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/hanson"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hanson\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0SdiiPkr02EUdekHZJkt58"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/31\/2019 01:14:58 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lanco":{"id":"5028","name":"LANCO","friendly_url":"lanco","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>Multi-PLATINUM band LANCO&nbsp;is \"at the top of their game\"&nbsp;<strong>(Pitchfork)<\/strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em>as they continue to&nbsp;reveal the story behind their record-breaking debut album&nbsp;<strong>HALLELUJAH NIGHTS<\/strong>.

Our favorite artists say the difficult things out loud, so we don't have to -- but can learn how to.<\/p>\n<p>By the same token, lovelytheband translate emotions, anxieties, and feelings into lush, layered, and lively indie pop anthems. When the band was founded by lead singer Mitchy Collins, guitarist Jordan Greenwald and drummer Sam Price in 2017, the trio maintain a lasting connection to listeners by holding nothing back.<\/p>\n<p>\"I really believe the importance of songwriting is saying something when someone else doesn't know how to,\" affirms Mitchy. \"In the songs, I'm talking about life, trials, tribulations, depression, anxiety, and shit I deal with as well as the headaches that come along with the good and bad days. My problems don't define me, but we should embrace every side of who we are. The message is, 'Everything will be fine.'\"<\/p>\n<p>This message immediately resonated among audiences everywhere. A centerpiece of the everything I could never say... EP, the group's debut single \"broken\" caught fire as \"the longest running #1 track on Alternative Radio thus far in 2018\" with six weeks at the top. In under a year, it amassed 25 million total global streams. BuzzFeed summed it up as \"So. Damn. Good.\" Billboard proclaimed the group among \"10 Rock &amp; Alternative Artists to Watch in 2018\" as they supported Vance Joy and AWOLNATION on tour between headlining dates everywhere. Everything paved the way for the arrival of the band's first full-length, finding it hard to smile [RED MUSIC]. Produced by \"broken\" collaborator Christian Medice, these 16 tracks entrance, engage, and enchant, offsetting shimmering keys, sweeping synths, and spacey guitars with cathartic, compelling, and catchy choruses.<\/p>\n<p>The title speaks directly to its thematic push-and-pull.<\/p>\n<p>\"finding it hard to smile touches on my life,\" says Mitchy. \"There are days when it's hard to even walk out of my front door or get out of bed. So, you find the will to power through, call on your friends, and rely on loved ones to pick you up when you're down and bring magic out of you. A lot of the record is about embracing who you are as well as dealing with relationships, breakups, nostalgia, and unrequited love. It's really introspective for me.\"<\/p>\n<p>They preceded the album's release with the single \"these are my friends,\" which quickly cracked 2 million streams worldwide. Wound up by faint guitar and a chant, \"These are my friends, these are my friends, I love them,\" the track crescendos towards an ambitious arena-ready hook.<\/p>\n<p>\"I was walking around Los Angeles one day thinking,\" he recalls. \"I left a party where I had a really good time at. Right after, I wrote the main lyric in my phone. I held onto it for a little while, but it eventually turned into a song about wanting love and wanting to fit in. I brought it to the guys in the studio, and they really took it to the next level. It becomes a lovelytheband song when everyone is on it.\"<\/p>\n<p>Whether it's the feedback buzz and 808 rush of \"pity party\" or orchestral ambiance on \"alone time,\" the soundscapes mirror the emotional ebb and flow encoded in the lyrics. Elsewhere, the intimate \"maybe i'm afraid\" unveils an infectious confession as the band admits their fears without filter.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's one of my proudest moments as a songwriter,\" says the frontman. \"It turned into the story of relationship. You're in it. You know things are beautiful, but you're scared to commit to the other personal. I think a lot of people struggle with the same thing. It feels relatable.\"<\/p>\n<p>As they round out 2018 on a headlining tour and hitting the stages of Lollapalooza, the Billboard Hot 100 Festival, and more, lovelytheband's voice will only get dramatically louder.<\/p>\n<p>It might just make crowds feel better too...<\/p>\n<p>\"I hope when you listen to it, you can find some solace or reassurance,\" Mitchy leaves off.<\/p>\n<p>\"Maybe you didn't know how to communicate something aloud, and it helps for us to talk about it. Hearing it might inspire you to make a move. Music moved me and gave me a little hope as a kid. I hope you can take away something from this in the same way my favorite records helped me. That would be my biggest goal with lovelytheband.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_lovelytheband_2_42_20_PM_2_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 28 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 28","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lovelytheband"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lovelytheband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4KJ6jujcNPzOyhdNoiNftp"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lovelytheband"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/lovelytheband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCcJhT3fYzmHAFr6PrIrz15A"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/23\/2019 03:44:59 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chris-robinson-brotherhood":{"id":"5081","name":"Chris Robinson Brotherhood","friendly_url":"chris-robinson-brotherhood","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>\"Masterful players on a Grail-like search for the cosmic heart of California.\" - MOJO<\/p>\n<p>\"&hellip;good-time music on an end-times mission.\" - ROLLING STONE<\/p>\n<p>\"...trailblazing a wonderfully refreshing slice of 'Rock N Roll' music.\" - AQUARIUM DRUNKARD<\/p>\n<p>\"&hellip;a celebration of how American musical traditions can be at once honored and psychedelically expanded.\" - UNCUT<\/p>\n<p>The Chris Robinson Brotherhood are on tour in support of their latest studio album 'Barefoot In The Head.&rsquo; In the middle of one of their most prolific periods to date, the band is riding a creative wave with a slew of studio and live records coming out amidst a rigorous tour schedule that only seems to fuel their fire even further. Their stellar new album, 'Barefoot In The Head,' marks the CRB's third studio release in just two years, and it finds them pushing boundaries and breaking new ground with more joy and wonder than ever before. Overspilling with stunning musicianship and infectious energy, the album showcases the continued growth of Robinson's songwriting partnership with his bandmates: guitarist Neal Casal, drummer Tony Leone, keyboardist Adam MacDougall, and bassist Jeff Hill. It revels in the kind of adventurousness that can only come from five artists tuned into the same sonic wavelength.<\/p>\n<p>'Barefoot In The Head' follows last year's critically acclaimed LP, 'Any Way You Love, We Know How You Feel,' and its companion EP, 'If You Lived Here, You Would Be Home By Now.' It opens with the Americana funk of \"Behold The Seer,\" which sounds like something of a mission statement for the CRB as Robinson sings, \"If you want to keep your engine humming \/ Keep your eyes wide ahead and don't look back.\" On the dreamy \"She Shares My Blanket,\" Robinson crafts cinematic scenes from a winter love affair in the mountains, while elegant pedal steel added by special guest Barry Sless on \"Blonde Light Of Morning\" casts a warm, romantic haze and \"Blue Star Woman\" sounds like T-Rex dressed in overalls living on a West Coast commune. Throughout the album, Robinson and the band deftly intertwine country, blues and psychedelia, even channeling freewheeling 60s' folk on \"Hark The Herald Hermit Speaks,\" a breakneck stream of consciousness that blurs the lines between fantasy and reality. On the English psych inspired \"Glow,\" which Robinson calls \"one of the most special things I've ever done in the studio,\" The CRB are joined by the celebrated sarodist Alam Khan (son of the legendary Ali Akbar Khan).<\/p>\n<p>\"The music that we make, the concerts that we play, it's this world we've created for ourselves and our people,\" explains Robinson. \"We want everybody to understand that no matter where you are in your life that you can always be barefoot in your head. There's always this other place you can go. Is that place it real? That&rsquo;s your decision to make, what you're going to let be real to you.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Chris Robinson Brotherhood emerged in 2011 by playing close to 50 shows over nine weeks in California before ever leaving the Golden State or officially releasing music.

Feeling Strangely Fine sold over two million copies worldwide and remains a touchstone of late-90&rsquo;s alternative rock. &ldquo;Closing Time,&rdquo; the band&rsquo;s biggest hit, for which they received a Grammy nomination, was ubiquitous around the world and remains a familiar and recurrent radio presence in many countries. &ldquo;Secret Smile,&rdquo; which became a chart-topping single in UK and Europe a year after the album&rsquo;s release in the US, is equally long-lived.<\/p>\n<p>After the release of&nbsp;<em>All About Chemistry<\/em>&nbsp;in 2001, the members of Semisonic continued to perform as a band while also pursuing their various artistic endeavors, often in collaboration with one another. &nbsp;Dan Wilson has released several solo albums:&nbsp;<em>Free Life&nbsp;<\/em>(2007) on which both Munson and Slichter perform,&nbsp;<em>Love Without Fear<\/em>&nbsp;(2014), and&nbsp;<em>Recovered<\/em>&nbsp;(2017), the latter two accompanied by books written and illustrated by Wilson. &nbsp;As a song writer and producer, he has collaborated with a wide range of artists&mdash;the Dixie Chicks (with whom he co-wrote the Grammy-winning &ldquo;Not Ready to Make Nice&rdquo;), Adele (with whom he co-wrote &ldquo;Someone Like You&rdquo; and earned a Grammy in his role as a producer), and many others including Chris Stapleton, Phantogram, Pink, Mike Posner, John Legend, Dierks Bentley, Celine Dion. &nbsp;Wilson has toured&nbsp;the US, UK and Europe, presenting his show Words &amp; Music by Dan Wilson, an evening of songs and stories that pull back the curtain on the art of songwriting.<\/p>\n<p>John Munson continues his work as a performing and recording artist in The Twin Cities. He has recorded and toured extensively with The New Standards, a minimalist jazz trio that performs punk and indie-rock classics. The New Standards have released four studio albums&mdash;<em>The New Standards <\/em>(2005), <em>Rock and Roll<\/em> (2008), <em>Sunday Morning Coming Down <\/em>(2012), and <em>Decade<\/em> (2015&mdash;three holiday EPs, presided over a twelve-year run of sold out holiday shows featuring collaborations with many of the finest artists on the Minneapolis scene (including Dan, who produced their first two albums). The New Standards have played nationwide, from Lincoln Center to Anchorage, AK. John has continued a lifetime collaboration with Dan&rsquo;s brother Matt, currently recording and playing as The Twilight Hours.&nbsp; He has been the recipient of several ArtsTour Grants from The Minnesota State Arts Board, and has kept himself busy producing and playing with some of Minneapolis&rsquo; best and brightest young artists. His current projects include a solo record, a new musical with Dylan Hicks, and producing a new record for Lucy Michelle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jacob Slichter&rsquo;s critically acclaimed memoir of life in the music business, <em>So You Wanna Be a Rock and Roll Star<\/em>, was released in 2004 and is regarded by people throughout the music business as required reading &ndash; in <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;A killer account of the absurdity of life inside the majors&rsquo; hitmaking machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has written for the New York Times and been a commentator for National Public Radio&rsquo;s <em>Morning Edition<\/em>. Since 2013, he has been a professor of creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College, while continuing his work as a drummer and string arranger.<\/p>\n<p>The band&rsquo;s most recent activity includes performances marking the twentieth anniversaries of their first two albums. In October of 2018, Universal Music Group released a deluxe, 20<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary edition of <em>Feeling Strangely Fine<\/em>.

She has been a recording artist and touring performer for twenty-five years, paving the way for countless music artists, particularly women, who count her among their major influences. Her deeply clever and often brutally candid songs have been garnering critical praise since she began her career in the early 1990s in Chicago by self-releasing audio cassettes under the name Girly-Sound. The intense viral response to these early tracks led to Phair signing with the independent record label Matador Records.<\/p>\n<p>Her 1993 debut studio album Exile in Guyville was released to international acclaim; it has been ranked by Rolling Stone as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, by Pitchfork as one of the 100 Greatest albums of the 90&rsquo;s and is considered one of the most accomplished debut albums for any artist in any genre to date. She was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, topped SPIN&rsquo;s 20 Best Albums of the Year, and reached No.1 on the Village Voice Pazz and Jop Critics Poll. Phair joined Lilith Fair in 1998-9, performing as a main stage headliner along with top female acts of the day like Sarah McLachlan, Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow and Missy Elliott.<\/p>\n<p>In Spring 2016 Liz toured with The Smashing Pumpkins on their North American &ldquo;In Plainsong&rdquo; tour. Liz is currently working on a new record, and will be touring in June.<\/p>\n<p>2018 marks the 25th Anniversary of Exile in Guyville.

Born in Asnes, Norway in 1991, Lagergren initially started out playing classical piano in his youth. It wasn't until his teenage years spent listening to his older brother's music collection -- including albums by Paul van Dyk, Tiesto, and Armin van Buuren -- that he became increasingly interested in electronic dance music. After high school, Lagergren, who had already started remixing and releasing tracks online as Matoma, furthered his studies by earning his Bachelor's degree in Music Technology from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. By 2014, he had started to gain international recognition for his Matoma remixes, including cuts for Jessie J, Akon, Enrique Iglesias, and others. In 2015, he scored a hit in Europe and New Zealand with a remix of Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Old Thing Back.\" Also in 2015, Lagergren released his own debut single as Matoma, \"Feeling Right (Everything Is Nice),\" featuring rapper Wale and Jamaican dancehall singer Popcaan. That track found its way onto his debut LP, Hakuna Matoma, which arrived at the end of the year. Additional guests included Becky Hill, Sean Paul, Astrid S, Akon, Frenship, and remixes of Dua Lipa's \"Hotter Than Hell,\" Jason Derulo's \"Try Me,\" and Coldplay's \"Adventure of a Lifetime.\" In 2017, Lagergren issued the single \"Girl at Coachella\" featuring Magic! and D.R.A.M. It was followed by \"Party on the West Coast,\" a tropical redux mix featuring Snoop Dogg and samples from Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G. which was a chart hit in Norway. Following the track \"Lonely,\" featuring MAX, Matoma announced the impending release of his follow-up LP One in a Million. ~ Matt Collar &amp; Neil Z.

For over 3 decades he has elevated and shaped an entire genre and remains one of the leading forces in the global music scene today.<\/p>\n<p>His most recent works have taken him from the DJ booth of the worlds hottest night spots and festivals to the studio producing soundtracks for Hollywood blockbuster movies. His diversity in artistry and ability has earned him accolades from critics and fans alike. Garnering him not 1 but 2 Grammy Nominations for his works.<\/p>\n<p>But let's take a step back. The son of a musician, Paul came up as a young DJ in the late '70s spinning Funk in Covent Garden. Not what some might have expected from one of Trances preeminent masters. But he knew then music would be his life. In the '80s 2 life-changing trips took place. The first in 1984 where he spent several months living in New York City working as A&amp;R man for the famed Champion Records signing DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. He also became promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.<\/p>\n<p>The second trip and more contemporary influence was in 1987 which brought Paul to the White Isle of Ibiza. Here he discovered the Balearic sound that flowed through the Ibiza air at clubs such as Amnesia. Inspired, he took the music and experiences back to the UK and became its ambassador. Paul returned often holding residencies at Amnesia and Pacha in Ibiza. Around the same time Ministry Of Sound in London was opening and touted Paul as their first resident. However it was his famed residency at UK superclub Cream in Liverpool that brought Paul global respect as a master of his art. It was some say the catalyst to what has made him a touring legend.<\/p>\n<p>This residency was celebrated through the Grammy nominated 2004 compilation &lsquo;Creamfields&rsquo; (Paul went on to receive a second Grammy nomination in 2007 with his artist album, &ldquo;A Lively Mind&rdquo; and then again in 2009 for his production work with Madonna).<\/p>\n<p>Oakenfold&rsquo;s stature as a DJ and entertainer has taken him beyond the normal club and festival circuit, playing landmark gigs that have changed the face of electronic music. Highlights include three worldwide tours warming up for Madonna and U2 (with both artists insisting on a DJ set from Paul instead of a support band); performing physically on the Great Wall of China and two sold out dates playing to 30,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in California.<\/p>\n<p>A year after that first visit to Ibiza, Perfecto was born. Founded in 1988, Oakenfold&rsquo;s groundbreaking Perfecto record label played an integral role in the birth of trance music, with Paul at the helm producing massive international hits such as &ldquo;Not Over Yet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bullet In The Gun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Southern Sun&rdquo;. With countless high profile releases and remixes in its path, Perfecto Records is still the benchmark to which so many labels measure themselves. 20+ years later, Perfecto remains as cutting edge and popular as ever, even resurrecting its Perfecto Fluoro sub label in 2011. Probably Perfecto&rsquo;s most notable release was the recent double album &ldquo;Perfecto Las Vegas&rdquo; which held the #1 spot on the US iTunes dance chart for several weeks. This release solidified Paul&rsquo;s stronghold as an International DJ power player achieving the highest selling DJ compilation ever released in US history &ndash; with over half a million sales.<\/p>\n<p>Paul has produced for megastars such as U2, Madonna (including her latest release &ldquo;Celebration&rdquo;) and The Happy Mondays. As well as three acclaimed artist albums under his own name. He has remixed Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake and released over 20 DJ mix compilations. In recent years Paul has also been responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking film scores and cues for a long list of Hollywood blockbusters &ndash; including The Bourne Identity, Matrix Reloaded, Shrek 2, Swordfish and Collateral. But his most anticipated release is yet to come. Paul Oakenfold&rsquo;s newest artist album &lsquo;Pop Killer&rsquo; is scheduled for imminent release featuring The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Gnarls Barkley, OneRepublic and B.O.B.<\/p>\n<p>Astonishingly, despite all his success in the worlds of chart music and film, Oakenfold has found time to keep in touch with his roots as a club DJ.

The six-piece collective may have rocketed to mainstream success two years ago with their breakthrough hit \"Spirits,\" but have always been thinking one step ahead. For their new single \"Salvation,\" out November 30, the group looked back to ideas that were hatched around the time of its eponymous debut EP in 2009, parsing through voice notes that predated the first album.<br \/><br \/>\"It's like a jigsaw puzzle,\" explains Simon Ward, The Strumbellas' vocalist, acoustic guitarist and main songwriter. \"I find pieces that feel like they could fit together, then I change the tempo and melody until it sparks. I say alright! This is what I've got! Then it gets pushed forward and everyone gets in and adds their parts.\"<br \/><br \/>For the group, which also consists of David Ritter (keys), Jeremy Drury (percussion), Isabel Ritchie (strings), Jon Hembrey (guitar) and Darryl James (bass), \"Salvation\" marks a stylistic turn from their melancholy, introspective releases. Over a punching backbeat, Ward sings optimistically of life and the good that it can bring: \"I like to dance under streetlamps and walk upon the clouds\/I like to shout from the rooftops and surf on top of the crowd\/For many years, many years I was scared of the person I was\/And I'm not perfect, they say, but I know that I was born to be loved.\"<br \/><br \/>\"A lot of our music is known for being dark,\" says Ritter. \"I like that people can turn to our music in dark times, but we were interested in seeing whether we could make something a little more hopeful and positive. I think the song has a more positive feel than our previous stuff.\"<br \/><br \/>\"Salvation,\" produced by Tim Pagnotta (Elle King, Walk the Moon), is a decidedly notable pivot towards pop for The Strumbellas, which describes itself as a primarily \"country, folky band.\" But they also explain that they're \"pop music junkies,\" and that their catalog has been edging towards an increasingly accessible sound from the start. \"Our whole dream has been to make cool, small-town music with just a fun, poppy feeling,\" says Ward. \"Every record we do, we get closer to that. 'Salvation' is exactly what we wanted to do, what we were hoping to get out of this song and record: fun, poppy songs that are sad and weird.\"<br \/><br \/>The band, which is currently in the studio working on its fourth album, is riding high on the success of its last project Hope, which released in 2016 via Glassnote Music (world ex-Canada) \/ Six Shooter Records (Canada). \"Spirits\" became a runaway hit for The Strumbellas, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and cracking the international market in countries including Germany, Italy and France. They spent the past few years on the road, touching down at festivals including Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. In 2017, they won the iHeartRadio Music award for Best New Alternative Rock Artist of the Year, and collected the JUNO Award for Single of the Year ahead of Drake, The Weeknd and Shawn Mendes.<br \/><br \/>For The Strumbellas, though, accolades are secondary to connecting with their fans, and making sure their music is received the way that they intended. \"If we can add a little of color to somebody's day, that's the ball game for me,\" says Ritter. \"Everything we put out is genuine,\" adds Ward. \"I want 10 million people to sing these songs in my lifetime and I can be there to sing it with them in the crowd, on the same level. I just want everyone to believe in it and love it and be part of the journey.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_StrumbellasThe_2_07_08_PM_5_14_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thestrumbellas"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thestrumbellas\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6ujr1NkqbZpYOhquczUUfl"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thestrumbellas"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/thestrumbellas.ca\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thestrumbellas"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 02:47:08 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"neon-trees":{"id":"5286","name":"Neon Trees","friendly_url":"neon-trees","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>Hailed by <em>Rolling Stone<\/em> as \"a New Wave pop powerhouse,\" Neon Trees first united in 2006 and instantly attracted acclaim and attention for their kaleidoscopic sound and affirmative vision, showcased on 2010's extraordinary debut album, <em>HABITS<\/em>.

In the 15 years since their formation, the band&rsquo;s infectious vitality has only magnified in appeal, as proven with the release of their 2018 album <em>Free <\/em><em>Yourself <\/em><em>Up<\/em>. Along with earning lavish acclaim, the Boston-bred act&rsquo;s most recent full-length debuted in the top ten on the Billboard 200, and spent a virtually unprecedented seven-and-a-half months on the non-commercial radio charts.<\/p>\n<p>Their most intimate and collaborative work to date, <em>Free Yourself Up <\/em>finds Lake Street Dive expanding their sound with more intricate textures, fuller-bodied arrangements, and stacks of sublime background harmonies. The album&rsquo;s title serves as both an exhortation to listeners and a statement of purpose for the band, its songs unfolding with a joyful swagger even when channeling anxiety over the state of the world. &ldquo;This album is based in the realities in our time, which have inevitably become part of everyone&rsquo;s daily life,&rdquo; notes Kearney. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something you think about and obsess over&mdash;and write songs about. <em>Free Yourself Up <\/em>is about empowering yourself, emboldening yourself, no matter what&rsquo;s going wrong.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Lake Street Dive came to life in 2004, when the original members were studying at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston; Akie Bermiss joined the band on keys in 2017. Over the coming years, the band steadily built a following through a series of independent album releases, countless club tours, and a few lucky breaks. In 2016 they made their Nonesuch Records debut with <em>Side Pony<\/em>, an album deemed &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; by Rolling Stone. Arriving in May 2018, <em>Free Yourself Up <\/em>drew praise from outlets like PopMatters&mdash;who, on their Best Pop Albums of 2018 list, noted that <em>Free <\/em><em>Yourself <\/em><em>Up <\/em>&ldquo;cleverly pulls off the rare hat-trick of not only being the band&rsquo;s most instantly accessible album but also their best&rdquo;&mdash;while lead single &ldquo;Good Kisser&rdquo; held fast in the top 5 at Americana radio for over a month. Most recently, Lake Street Dive released <em>Freak Yourself Out<\/em>: a five-song 10-inch EP composed of bonus tracks from the <em>Free <\/em><em>Yourself <\/em><em>Up <\/em>sessions.<\/p>\n<p>Known for their kinetic live show, Lake Street Dive are now set to embark on a headlining tour of Europe in April. With plans to record new music later this year, the band will also hit the road for a run with The Avett Brothers this summer, including dates at L.A.&rsquo;s Greek Theatre and Colorado&rsquo;s Red Rocks Amphitheatre. In addition, Lake Street Dive&rsquo;s summer touring plans include appearances at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the Newport Folk Festival.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LakeStreetDive_3_31_53_PM_3_11_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 9:30 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"9:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lakestreetdive"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.lakestreetdive.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lakestreetdive"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/LakeStreetDive"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lakestreetdive\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3nuc29fYGlQbIrwh4yrNWd"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/22\/2019 10:10:12 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"los-lonely-boys":{"id":"4988","name":"Los Lonely Boys","friendly_url":"los-lonely-boys","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>&ldquo;We decided to call this album Revelation because we want to make music that reveals something to people about their lives and their world,&rdquo; says Jojo Garza. He&rsquo;s talking about the new release by Los Lonely Boys, the close-knit Texas trio that the bassist\/vocalist shares with his brothers Henry (vocals, guitar) and Ringo (drums, vocals). &ldquo;As musicians and artists, we&rsquo;re here to connect with people, and to share our view of things.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Revelation &mdash; to be released on the band&rsquo;s own LonelyTone imprint Jan. 21, 2014, in association with the respected Austin-based indie Playing in Traffic &mdash; is a landmark release for the siblings. While maintaining the infectiously melodic mix of bluesy rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll and rootsy brown-eyed soul that&rsquo;s long endeared Los Lonely Boys to its fiercely loyal fan base, Revelation adds an expansive range of new sonic elements, e.g. the conjunto touches of &ldquo;Blame It On Love,&rdquo; the reggae groove of &ldquo;Give A Little More,&rdquo; the rustic acoustic textures of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Just My Heart Talkin&rsquo; and the baroque pop elements of &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Always Tomorrow.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always trying to broaden our horizons and advance musically, and that&rsquo;s something that we were very conscious of in making this record,&rdquo; Jojo states. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking for new ways to communicate and reach people, so we experimented with a lot of different sounds and production approaches.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Toward that end, the brothers also collaborated with an eclectic cast of co-writers in assembling the dozen new original songs that comprise Revelation, including alt-country icon Radney Foster, in-demand pop tunesmiths Matthew Gerrard and David Qui&ntilde;ones, Black-Eyed Peas collaborators George Pajon Jr. and Keith Harris, and Raul Pacheco of Ozomatli.<\/p>\n<p>Revelation also marks Los Lonely Boys&rsquo; first recording work since Henry Garza sustained serious injuries in a fall from the stage during a February 2013 performance in Los Angeles, necessitating a lengthy and ongoing recovery period.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We nearly lost Henry, man, and that was a big change for us,&rdquo; Jojo acknowledges. &ldquo;The whole experience was a wake-up call for us. It made us rethink every aspect of our lives and our careers, and it reminded us of what&rsquo;s really important to us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The abiding sense of family unity and creative rapport that allowed the band to weather such a potentially devastating event has been built into Los Lonely Boys from the beginning. Indeed, Henry, Jojo and Ringo have been making music together for their entire lives. Their father, Ringo Garza Sr., was a member of another sibling band, the Falcones, which played throughout southern Texas in the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s. When that group disbanded, Ringo Sr. went solo, and recruited his three young sons to back him. The family relocated to Nashville in the &rsquo;90s, and soon Henry, Jojo and Ringo Jr. began writing and performing their own material as a trio.<\/p>\n<p>After moving back to Texas, the brothers recorded their eponymous debut album in 2003 at Willie Nelson&rsquo;s Pedernales studio in Austin, with Willie himself guesting on the sessions. Although originally released on small Or Music label, Epic Records picked up Los Lonely Boys for major-label distribution in early 2004. The album quickly won the band a large national audience. Its lead single &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; became a Top 20 pop hit, reached the #1 spot on Billboard&rsquo;s Adult Contemporary chart, and eventually won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.<\/p>\n<p>After a prominent guest appearance on the 2005 Santana album All That I Am, Los Lonely Boys solidified their success with 2006&rsquo;s Sacred, which brought two more Grammy nominations, and 2008&rsquo;s Forgiven, as well as the holiday-themed Christmas Spirit. Meanwhile, the band continued to build its reputation as a singularly powerful live act.<\/p>\n<p>In early 2009, Los Lonely Boys made their LonelyTone\/Playing in Traffic debut with the all-covers EP 1969, followed by the unplugged Keep On Giving: Acoustic Live! Those releases set the stage for the band&rsquo;s acclaimed 2011 album Rockpango, and for the creative leap forward that Revelation represents.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want to make music that brings people together, not music that divides people,&rdquo; Jojo states. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all about having a good time, but we also make an effort to write about things that really matter. A lot of people write songs about superficial things, like how you look and what kind of car you drive and how much money you have, but we&rsquo;re not interested in that. We want to create music that&rsquo;s about the love and the energy and the spirit that we all carry as people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very thankful that God blessed our family with a drummer, a guitar player and a bass player, and that the three of us get to make music together,&rdquo; Jojo concludes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a few bumps in the road here and there, but that happens in any family and in any band. The main thing is that we stick together, and that we&rsquo;re trying to pass on that feeling of brotherhood, of familia, in the music that we make.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LosLonelyBoys_11_03_26_AM_3_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/loslonelyboys"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/loslonelyboys.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/loslonelyboys"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/loslonelyboys"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/los_lonely_boys\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4aSEmLLxLX9wR5aLMllOKj"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/12\/2019 11:05:05 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jimmie-allen":{"id":"4982","name":"Jimmie Allen","friendly_url":"jimmie-allen","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>The epitome of the phrase &ldquo;persistence pays off,&rdquo; Jimmie Allen laid it all on the line to make his dreams a reality.

Over the past year, the L.A.-based artist continued to captivate with her sophomore effort&nbsp;Hiding Place: a passion project whose R&amp;B-tinged take on classic gospel won Best Gospel Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards (with the chart-topping single &ldquo;Never Alone&rdquo; taking the Best Gospel Performance\/Song prize).

It got to the point that if they were listening to something else, all I had to do was get in the car and they'd automatically flip over to country.\"<\/p>\n<p>Coming from a family with deep musical roots, the Stoney Creek Records&rsquo; artist started playing piano and guitar at a very early age. \"I learned how to play guitar traveling to country-bluegrass camps with my dad, and knew right from the beginning of my strong passion for country music.\"<\/p>\n<p>Starting on piano at siX, guitar at eight and singing in her church youth group at 10 (\"the most forgiving audience ever\"), The 24-year-old Calgary native was discovered at 13 by BTO and The Guess Who's Randy Bachman (\"American Woman,\" \"Takin' Care Of Business\"). \"Randy learned guitar from master jazz guitarist Lenny Breau, so I dove head-first into this world of blues, jazz and rock guitar &ndash; learning all these different solos, switching radio stations and trying to get an idea of where all those techniques come from. I was listening to HendriX, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Clapton, Derek Trucks and all those incredible guitar players.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Lindsay&rsquo;s passion and study has served her well, leading to several unique opportunities, including an opening slot with blues icon Buddy Guy; however, her first songwriting trip to Nashville was the catalyst that brought her early affinity for country full-circle. \"When I got here, it was like I was home,\" she says. \"I didn't need to put on a facade of who I was or wasn't. And I finally fell back into my roots. Coming to Nashville brought me to who I am and who I'm meant to be.\"<\/p>\n<p>This Fall, Lindsay will embark upon one of her most eXciting opportunities to-date: an opening slot on The Band Perry&rsquo;s We Are Pioneers World Tour encompassing 50 dates throughout Europe and North America and kicking off November 8 in Gothenberg, Sweden.<\/p>\n<p>Because it is rare, she knows her siX-string prowess is not the only focal point, but an accent to her vision as an artist.\"There aren't a lot of girls who play electric lead guitar, and it can be a defining thing,\" she says. First and foremost, I want people to hear me and understand my voice as a country music recording artist. When they come see me, I'd love it if they were impressed at my guitar and piano playing. But by that point, hopefully they understand the artist behind it all has a lot of different sides to her music.\"<\/p>\n<p>To get to that point, she knows radio will be key &ndash; and she can't wait. &ldquo;Going out on a radio tour and having the chance to share my music and show people how ready I am is the most eXciting step I've made yet.\"<\/p>\n<p>Having spent a decade learning about the music industry from the front of a stage, Lindsay Ell is more than ready for that step &ndash; however big or small. \"Playing live, honing my craft and developing as performer before taking my first serious try at being a recording artist and getting radio airplay gives me a foundation a lot of artists just don't get. I've had the cords fail, the monitors shut down and mics die. I've seen all kinds of crowds ... and no crowd at all. I feel ready as a singer and a musician. I have confidence as a performer. I've been writing for years and, since moving to Nashville, have found how best to communicate who I am. I'm comfortable in a conference room with siX people or onstage opening for Keith Urban in front of thousands. It's really not that different. Both are eXciting and a little humbling. Either way, I'm ready to go.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LindseyEll_7_32_32_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officiallindsayell\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lindsayell\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4lpA7MWpQpY7hKkwfLxw2Q"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lindsayell"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.lindsayell.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/lindsayell"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/17\/2019 02:26:51 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"max":{"id":"5284","name":"MAX","friendly_url":"max","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>MAX is a New York City born pop-soul singer, actor &amp; dancer, known for his powerful acrobatic tenor which commands attention.

They change, learn, and grow as one. However, Los Angeles band JOHNNYSWIM doesn't just seem like a family; it is a family. At the core, husband-and-wife -- Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano -- translate the memories, moments, and milestones on their journey into spirited, slick, and soulful anthems steeped in singer-songwriter tradition, yet ampli?ed by alternative experimentation, rock energy, and pop ambition.<br \/><br \/>The music moves as the couple's life does, scrapbooking unforgettable experiences in melody like an eternal keepsake of their relationship.<br \/><br \/>\"The music is the backdrop on which our life gets painted,\" a?rms Abner. \"We're not just writing partners; we're partners. There's no balance between work and romance. It's all a gumbo. Our ?rst excuse to date and hang out was writing together. We say things better in song than we discuss them in person. We've seen terrible things, brilliant things, and beautiful things as a couple. The albums and performances become the canvas that loss, gain, romance, and love are subconsciously painted -- unbeknownst to us, honestly.\"<br \/><br \/>\"I add intimacy, and he adds ?re,\" exclaims Amanda. \"It's important to have both. That's really the balance of what JOHNNYSWIM is.\"<br \/><br \/>Like any lasting relationship (whether musical or romantic), that balance didn't crystallize overnight either...<br \/><br \/>As the story goes, Abner felt love-at-?rst sight upon seeing Amanda. Immediately, he thought, \"That's the girl I'm going to marry.\" The only problem was he declared it aloud in front of his date (who promptly became his last ex). To add insult to injury, Amanda shrugged him o? with an eye-roll as well. Four years passed until their paths crossed again at a 2005 Nashville writing session. The relationship experienced its makeups and breakups before they married in 2009 -- a year removed from the arrival of their self-titled debut EP, JOHNNYSWIM.<br \/><br \/>Building a fanbase through constant touring, 2013's Heart Beats EP spawned \"Don't Let It Get You Down,\" which clocked 17 million-plus Spotify streams. Their ?rst full-length, Diamonds, arrived in 2014 as its single \"Home\" famously became the theme to HGTV hit Fixer Upper. The 2016 follow-up Georgica Pond yielded another fan favorite \"First Try\" as the duo sold out dates around the world. Along the way, they garnered acclaim from Rolling Stone, NPR, The New York Times, Hu?ngton Post, Nylon, Du Jour, and VH1 in addition to performing on The Today Show, CONAN, and more.<br \/><br \/>In early 2017, JOHNNYSWIM commenced work on ideas for what would become their 2019 third full- length, Moonlight [Britannia Row Recordings\/BMG]. Amidst a series of professional changes and Amanda's pregnancy with their second child, they kick-started the next chapter.<br \/><br \/>\"All of the signs pointed towards brand new beginnings and brand new starts,\" Abner admits. \"With all of those feelings, there was anticipation in the air for something fresh. I had produced everything up until this point. We wanted to engage a producer who could free us up to experiment. It all began by anticipating something new. In an unforeseen way, that new thing was working with Malay.\"<br \/><br \/>Over the course of the next year, they wrote and recorded with GRAMMY<strong>&reg;&nbsp;<\/strong>Award-winning producer and songwriter Malay [Frank Ocean, Sam Smith]. The musicians went from writing in the producer's Brooklyn apartment (where he cooked them a delicious tomahawk steak during their ?rst session) to his new Britannia Row Recordings studio in Hollywood. Ajer recording in home studios throughout their career, the new setting o?ered the same intimacy as well as a breath of fresh air.<br \/><br \/>\"I was pregnant when we started, and Luna was born in the middle of the process -- which was a ?rst for us,\" recalls Amanda. \"It was a really welcoming environment though. We were all so comfortable. Malay made it so we could just focus on the songs, while he handled recording. We'd build the structures, and he'd put this magic around them like our fairy godfather,\" she laughs.<br \/><br \/>That magic carries through all twelve tracks. Opener \"Bridges\" hinges on echoing guitar and a steady beat as Amanda and Abner belt out the incendiary chant, \"Let's burn the bridges down. Light 'em up. Don't turn it around. No escape through the ashes now.\"<br \/><br \/>\"It felt representative of the album and these days of our life together,\" explains Abner. \"I don't know what's ahead of us, but I'm know I'm willing to burn down everything that's behind us. That's what marriage is. That's what family is. That's committing yourself. When you commit to raising your kids, you burn the bridges to your past self. You're a new person. We're not going backwards. I'm willing to risk everything for what's ahead of us. It's our anthem.\"<br \/><br \/>Elsewhere, a stomping groove and delicately plucked acoustic guitar underscore a charismatic and con?dent send-o? on \"Say What You Will.\"<br \/><br \/>\"I wouldn't say anything to my eighteen-year-old self, but I'd say something to those around him who disregarded and downplayed this dream,\" Abner sighs. \"A lot of people are unwilling to take chances. So, they project their fears on you and tell you to stop taking chances. They have to justify the reasons they haven't pursued their dreams or chased a passion. I'd say, 'Do what you need to do, but we're going to be just ?ne.'\"<br \/><br \/>Then, there's \"The Last Time\" [feat. Michael McDonald]. Resounding piano keys, lithe guitar, and handclaps resound as Amanda, Abner, and the legendary Michael McDonald lock into an unshakable call-and-response recorded seaside in Santa Barbara.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\"It was surreal,\" smiles Amanda. \"Michael's voice is just unbelievable. To record with him was amazing.\"<br \/><br \/>\"Lyrically, it's our story,\" says Abner. \"The moment I saw Amanda for the ?rst time was the last time I dated anybody else. It's a special one.\"<br \/><br \/>The album illuminates the expanse of JOHNNYSWIM's musical palette. \"Marietta\" gallops from a jazz-y intro into theatrical delivery about Abner leaving his hometown. The ?nale \"Same Old Thing\" examines the fragility of marriage and frayed bonds as the lyrics tackle divorces among the pair's friends over listless guitar.<br \/><br \/>\"I love putting it last, because it's a reminder this album isn't about the sweetness of love,\" Abner says. \"It's about the reality of love.\"<br \/><br \/>\"There's a theme to Moonlight,\" Amanda elaborates. \"It's love, but not the ideal or romance of love. It's all of the things that actually come with loving someone and caring about someone who's not perfect. There's tragedy in it. There's frustration in it. There's joy in it. That's Moonlight.\"<br \/><br \/>In the end, JOHNNYSWIM emerge stronger than ever together as a family and a band on Moonlight.<br \/><br \/>\"I'd love for people to hear Moonlight and feel known, seen, and unashamed regardless of where they're at on the spectrum of romance -- whether it's ?rst fast love, making babies, or in the middle of a dream that's falling apart,\" Abner leaves o?. \"I want them to feel like we're speaking for them no matter what.\"<br \/><br \/>\"You can listen to a record and walk away feeling like your spirit is nourished,\" Amanda concludes. \"That's what I want. I hope it marks a time for you and your family, where you can associate these songs with those special moments.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JOHNNYSWIM_6_10_10_PM_5_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JOHNNYSWIM\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/johnnyswim\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4igDSX1kgfWbVTDCywcBGm"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnnyswim"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.johnnyswim.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/johnnyswim"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/22\/2019 03:09:27 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"yungblud":{"id":"5058","name":"YUNGBLUD","friendly_url":"yungblud","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>Emerging from the gritty north of England, YUNGBLUD brings an explosion of raw energy and thought-provoking lyrics.

One thing about having nine studio recordings is that it&rsquo;s hard to fit everything into the set right now.

We always had the mindset of being an album-oriented band. We wanted to create the 10 or 12 best songs we could get on there. It wasn&rsquo;t like, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the hit. That&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;ll be on the radio.

But which one is the <em>best<\/em> one?&rdquo; he muses. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one I wrote yesterday, because that&rsquo;s the way I treat it. If I think I&rsquo;ve already written the best song I could write, then I need to stop. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even come close. My brother Dean tells me all the time, &lsquo;You just <em>live<\/em> for that next song!&rsquo; And I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Yeah.Yeah, I kinda do.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&mdash;<em>Mike Mettler, official Soulographer<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CollectiveSoul_2_38_35_PM_2_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/collectivesoul"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/collectivesoulofficial"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4e5V1Q2dKCzbLVMQ8qbTn6"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/collectivesoul"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.collectivesoul.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_m0bI82Rz_k"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/05\/2019 12:40:36 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"samantha-fish":{"id":"5954","name":"Samantha Fish","friendly_url":"samantha-fish","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SamanthaFish_2_55_50_PM_6_4_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.samanthafish.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/04\/2019 02:55:55 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"two-friends":{"id":"5098","name":"Two Friends","friendly_url":"two-friends","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>Matt Halper and Eli Sones, the young masterminds behind Two Friends, have quickly revamped from high school bedroom producers to one of the most promising dance<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">music duos of 2017.

They swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio.<br \/><br \/>With support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2018, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.<\/span><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TwoFriends_5_33_08_PM_3_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 3 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 3","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/twofriendsmusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/twofriendsmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/44Ewva5aHOX00EwaX2D2mh"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/twofriendsmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.twofriendsmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCJT9mKSioRGKo8PLUzgzzbA?sub_confirmation=1"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:05:04 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chris-lane":{"id":"5120","name":"Chris Lane","friendly_url":"chris-lane","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Since bursting onto the scene with his breakout #1 smash &ldquo;Fix,&rdquo; Chris Lane&rsquo;s star continues to rise with GOLD and PLATINUM level single certifications, two Top 10 albums and nearly 1 BILLION combined streams.

The journey has been private and public. The journey has at times been explicitly external, even while being driven by internal change. Now nearly thirteen years after the release of his first studio record, Matisyahu and his band have done something unmatched in his past repertoire; they have crafted that journey into a musically thematic eight song movement.<\/p>\n<p>The band features longtime guitarist Aaron Dugan, Dub Trio bassist and drummer Stu Brooks and Joe Tomino, and keyboard virtuoso BigYuki -- and the journey starts with them. The band improvised for hours in the studio with Matisyahu watching on as an admirer without singing a single lyric. Out of the improvisations grew melodic themes, rhythmic peaks and valleys, blissful and proto-song guitar passages, deep dub meditations and ultimately an inspired instrumental record until itself. Only once the band had crafted this musical narrative, did Matisyahu begin to work on a lyrical narrative of his own -- a lyrical narrative that is simultaneously informed and integrated with the music yet driven by Matisyahu's own personal journey. The result is Undercurrent, Matisyahu's sixth studio album.<\/p>\n<p>The record is musically Matisyahu's most courageous release to date and lyrically his most vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p>The courage in the music comes from trust. Trust in the band. And only in the band. There are no post-production bells and whistles or litany of special guests on Undercurrent. On the opening track, \"Step Out into the Light\" the band lays out a repetitive minimalist verse section that anchors the listener in a near meditative loop only to open up into a gorgeous set of chord changes that makes the chorus feel revelatory, as if the listener has earned this release, and can achieve the song-title's call to action.<\/p>\n<p>By the record's third track, \"Coming Up Empty\" the band has established melodic themes that will be called upon or re-harmonized later in the record, and just two songs in, it is clear that these musicians are road-tested, brave-song-crafters, with tens-of-thousands of hours of playing together embedded in their muscles and fortified in their bones.<\/p>\n<p>The vulnerability in the lyrics comes from acceptance. Acceptance in uncertainly. Acceptance in the actions of one's younger self and acceptance that while the future may be uncertain, having the courage to trust gives us all the best chance at meaningful relationships. It's a lyrical reframing of the Jewish philosophical differences between emunah (faith) and bitachon (trust). Faith, the constant, and trust the immediate. Matisyahu sets the stage for this conceptually on the record's opening track, but he digs in internally on the authoritative plea in the chorus of \"Back to the Old,\" [I'm giving up, I'm giving in \/ All I got is what's right in front of me \/ Is the people that I see...]. He projects it outwardly through questioning in \"Forest of Faith,\" [What's a man got to do, Oh! \/ To get through to you?] And finally works towards acceptance on the guitar-driven gem \"Headright, [And I know feelings come and go \/ How should hold on, should I let go].<\/p>\n<p>These forces direct the journey of Undercurrent, and as the record progresses the music begins to open up into full band improvisations like a relationship becoming more trusting, willing to take chances, knowing there's acceptance in the process. A stunning example of this is on the record's fifth track \"Tell Me.\" If you stop the song at the three-and-a-half-minute mark, you have a great reggae-tinged pop tune that promises to make a hit radio single. The track however continues for another six-and-half-minutes, beginning with a beautifully re-harmonized keyboard reference to the song's opening wordless vocal melody. From there the entire band begins to improvise. Each player speaking briefly but with purpose, adding slowly and deliberately to the conversation. Drums and bass falling in and out. Guitar and keyboards calling back and forth to each other. The listener can almost intuit the personalities of each musician. The musical conversation continues to build, each band member adding to the improvisation without playing on top of one another. Trust and respect. This is truly Matisyahu the band. Matisyahu the singer is patiently waiting for the band to direct the journey, and he joins back in with a near whisper as the rhythm section finds that incomparable dub groove Brooks and Tomino are famous for.<\/p>\n<p>The level of interplay between Matisyahu and his band mates on Undercurrent is unquestionable and requires multiple listens. Each repetition of a song reveals a guitar line from Dugan that elevates a vocal melody that only 15 years of experience together can achieve. Keyboard patterns from Yuki unrealized in a previous listen connect one song to another and the full band improvisations that climax with an impressive exploratory section on the record's final track \"Driftin'\" achieve the rare feat of capturing a band's live potential on a studio album.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Undercurrent, is a fully realized concept album crafted by a band-of-brothers who have learned to hold a conversation that is both comforting and challenging at the same time. It plays like a revelatory session with a great psychotherapist.<\/p>\n<p>Like someone watching an ocean wave move chaotically towards the shore unaware of the undercurrent pulling mightily back in the opposite direction, Matisyahu and his band have achieved a musical retelling of the Matisyahu story that explores the forces within that inspire us all, challenge us all, break us down, lift us up, and yet are rarely obvious to the outside observer.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Matisyahu_3_17_46_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/matisyahu"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/matisyahuworld.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/matisyahu"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/matisyahuTV"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/matisyahu\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5eyMzR1hYiEZtN2c9ly2kw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/20\/2019 01:55:01 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"soja":{"id":"5053","name":"SOJA","friendly_url":"soja","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>Nearly two decades ago, SOJA began as high school friends in a D.C. area basement teaching each other to be musicians and play roots reggae music. Today, the 2x GRAMMY-nominated eight-piece band, with over 7 million online followers and over 300 million Youtube views, headlines concerts all over the world for their massive dedicated fanbase. Even with their continued success, SOJA always wants to remember their time together in that basement inspired by each other&rsquo;s contributions and ideas.<\/p>\n<p>The feeling of true magic, collaboration and brotherhood that started it all is still evident today in their music and each night at their live concerts. For their latest studio album, Poetry In Motion (Oct 27 2017), it was essential for SOJA to consciously go back to the beginning and recapture that same sincere, collaborative magic sparked 20 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;For your whole life money is the thing you&rsquo;re scarce on,&rdquo; frontman Jacob Hemphill says. &ldquo;Then once you get busy enough time becomes the thing you&rsquo;re most scarce on. So spending time at home becomes your most valuable commodity and then the collaborative process starts taking place over the phone and email instead of in person. For Poetry In Motion we asked ourselves, &lsquo;What if we went back to the beginning and wrote, arranged, recorded and produced the entire thing together?&rsquo; All eight guys in one room to create something special. That was the approach to this record &ndash; to make something we truly love and did all together.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The band set up at Haunted Hollow Studios, Dave Matthews Band&rsquo;s studio, near Charlottesville, VA. The idea was to live and work together in one place, investing all their energy into the process. They spent three months in the studio over several sessions in late 2016 and early 2017, spending hours sitting on the back porch discussing music and life. Everyone showed up with new ideas, new instruments and new gear. The band enlisted Rob Evans, Ivan Guitierrez and Mariano Aponte to co- produce the songs, and there was an open-minded sentiment throughout. &ldquo;It was a learning and experimenting process,&rdquo; Jacobs notes. &ldquo;We got the exact thing we wanted from it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s 11 tracks embrace reggae completely, focusing on what the genre does best. They referred often to their 2009 album, Born In Babylon, to remind them of where they came from and how they&rsquo;d like to go forward. Poetry In Motion is the beginning of a chapter, but it&rsquo;s also a return to the past. It&rsquo;s a revitalization of what made SOJA so special to begin with. It&rsquo;s about eight guys in one room making reggae music that truly means something.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back to our roots and what we do best,&rdquo; Jacob says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re remembering why we started this band and the magic of what we&rsquo;ve built. We were lucky enough to create our own family and we picked every brother by hand. This album feels like we&rsquo;ve had an amazing family reunion. It&rsquo;s a blueprint for our future.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Poetry In Motion continues the band&rsquo;s belief that music should speak for people and uplift them. The album looks at the world today and asks why it feels like something is wrong when so much exists around us. \"Fire In the Sky,&rdquo; propulsive and upbeat, takes the positive outlook on humanity while &ldquo;Life Support,&rdquo; a more introspective song, tackles the negative outlook. All the other tracks fall somewhere in the middle, as Jacob and the band grapple with the human condition, unafraid of big topics and essential life queries.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The definition of the title is three-fold,&rdquo; Jacob says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poetry, the band&rsquo;s motion. The human race and the animals and plants that are spinning around on this Earth are beautiful &ndash; it&rsquo;s poetry flying through the universe in motion. And then, thirdly, we are this beautiful poetry but we keep moving away from it. Right now it feels like we&rsquo;re moving in the wrong direction and it&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album poses questions but never takes on a definitive reply. SOJA isn&rsquo;t offering an answer. Instead, the answers are out there for each listener to find on their own. \"There&rsquo;s no periods on anything,&rdquo; Jacob notes. &ldquo;I give hints and glimpses, but my own opinions on the human condition change every year. Sometimes I&rsquo;m climbing, sometimes I&rsquo;m sliding. So maybe I&rsquo;m not the right guy to be answering questions. But I can ask all these questions that matter and help people. I&rsquo;m out there fishing for the next person.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>His ultimate goal with each song is simple. &ldquo;How do I make the human condition come into this song?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How do I relate to the biggest family of all time? That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m ever really trying to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>SOJA&rsquo;s energetic, impassioned live performances have a similar effect. Averaging around 120 shows a year for the last decade, SOJA has toured with acts that include Dave Matthews Band, 311 and Incubus, and engaged a massive international fan base of die-hard followers at festivals that include Bonnaroo, Hangout Festival, Wakarusa, Cali Roots, Summerjam Germany, Woodstock Poland, Personal Festival Argentina, Ziget Festival Hungry and many more. Their live shows offer people a chance to look both inward and outward, and feel part of a global community, particularly since SOJA has headlined shows in over 30 countries. For SOJA, everything is about connection, whether it's with the world around them or within the band. &ldquo;Nothing worth doing in life can you do by yourself,&rdquo; Jacob notes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>SOJA is:<\/p>\n<p>Jacob Hemphill &ndash; Vocals \/ Guitar Bobby Lee &ndash; Bass<\/p>\n<p>Ryan Berty &ndash; Drums<\/p>\n<p>Patrick O&rsquo;Shea &ndash; Keyboards Ken Brownell &ndash; Percussion Hellman Escorcia &ndash; Saxophone Rafael Rodriguez &ndash; Trumpet Trevor Young &ndash; Guitar \/ Vocals<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Soja_11_19_49_AM_3_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/soja"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sojagram\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2vaWvC8suCFkRXejDOK7EE"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sojalive"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/sojamusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/SOJATube"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/09\/2019 09:19:13 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"riley-green":{"id":"4981","name":"Riley Green","friendly_url":"riley-green","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>Born in Jacksonville, Alabama, Riley Green was raised on the sounds of old traditional Country, Bluegrass, and Southern Gospel music.

But rising star Dylan Scott has made the trek.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like anything else, you have to work at it if you want it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sit back and expect someone else to make it happen for you, you&rsquo;ve gotta do it yourself.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With his romantic, PLATINUM certified #1 hit &ldquo;My Girl,&rdquo; and GOLD-certified Top 5 smash &ldquo;Hooked,&rdquo; Scott has certainly done that, paying his dues and transforming real-life experience into chart-topping success. Now with the album <em>DYLAN SCOTT DELUXE EDITION, <\/em>a new chapter begins.<\/p>\n<p>Born into a musical family, Scott&rsquo;s father played guitar for stars like Freddy Fender and Freddie Hart, regaling the youngster with stories from the road and encouraging his love for soul-bearing icons like Keith Whitley, Alan Jackson, and Tim McGraw. By the time Scott arrived in Nashville to start chasing his own dreams, he was still only in high school &ndash; but his drive was obvious for all to see.<\/p>\n<p>He began writing songs with anyone who was willing, and hit the road hard. Then, after a blistering rise through the Country ranks, his bootstrap pulling work ethic paid off in the summer of 2016. &ldquo;My Girl&rdquo; started marching to the top of the charts, earning Scott his first-ever PLATINUM certification and revealing an artist with a knack for hot-and-heavy sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>Fans got the message, and Scott&rsquo;s self-titled album debut landed at Number 5 on <em>Billboard<\/em>&rsquo;s Country Albums chart, helping him gather over 535 million on-demand streams and 4 million stream equivalent songs in the process. He made a triumphant Grand Ole Opry debut and launched a headlining tour, selling out some of the nation&rsquo;s biggest clubs for crowds of over 3,000 &ndash; but now he&rsquo;s circling back.<\/p>\n<p>With <em>DYLAN SCOTT DELUXE EDITION<\/em>, this total-package artist is bringing new fans up to speed on where he&rsquo;s been, and offering a look at where he&rsquo;s headed next.<\/p>\n<p>Three powerful new tracks join the original album&rsquo;s 13 songs, all featuring a high-octane mix of current Country and pop-friendly Southern rock that celebrates both his down-home roots and big-city ambitions. More than half of Scott&rsquo;s songs have flowed straight from the young star&rsquo;s pen, and more fans seem to latch on to his stories each day.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see people smiling and forgetting about the work week and whatever&rsquo;s going on in their life, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inspiring to me,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;You always think &lsquo;How cool would it be to write a song and go out to perform it, and have people know your music?&rsquo; But when it actually happens, it&rsquo;s even better than you imagined.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That feeling of connection first appeared as &ldquo;My Girl&rdquo; began its climb. Inspired by Scott and his wife Blair&rsquo;s 10-year romance, the breakout talent says he almost declined to record the song &ndash; it was too personal.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically me and my wife&rsquo;s love story, and I was thinking &lsquo;Nobody wants to hear all that mushy-gushy stuff,&rsquo;&rdquo; he says of the confirmed hit, co-written with Josh Kerr after Blair busted out an adorable (and unexpected) rap of Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lose Yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are times when your wife or girlfriend will do things she wouldn&rsquo;t do in front of anybody else. And us guys, we all see that in our girl &ndash; whether they realize it or not.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Learning to take those little moments and turn them into Country gold has sent Scott on the journey of a lifetime, and he&rsquo;s far from finished.<\/p>\n<p>Adding fuel to the romantic fire in his chest, <em>DYLAN SCOTT DELUXE EDITION<\/em> is filled with heart-pounding beats and detailed, real-life love stories, plus vocals that combine the tender timelessness of his idols with a dose of laid-back Country swagger. Still working with the production team of industry legend Jim Ed Norman, Matt Alderman and Curt Gibbs, each of the new tracks is unique.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hooked&rdquo; &ndash; penned by Seth Ennis, Morgan Evans, and Lindsey Rimes &ndash; is a propulsive, white-hot anthem of desire, perfect for cranked up backroad cruising and downtown dancing alike.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the lyrical attack and pounding rhythms of &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Take Her Anywhere&rdquo; hit like a punch to the gut, especially for anyone who&rsquo;s watched heads turn as their girl walks across the room. It was written by Scott with Kerr and pop specialist Mike Krompass.<\/p>\n<p>And meanwhile, the softer side of his muscular baritone wraps its arms around &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; a stripped-down co-write with Alderman and superstar Lee Brice that sets another private moment to music.<\/p>\n<p>Those three hits-in-the-making are just a taste of where Scott is going, and there&rsquo;s <em>much<\/em> more to come. With his Country dreams becoming reality and his first child, son Beckett born in December, a whole new world is about to open up. So lately, Scott&rsquo;s been taking the words of Blair&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Girl&rdquo; inspiring rap seriously &ndash; losing himself in the music, never letting go, and making his shot count.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It really hasn&rsquo;t sunk in yet that I have a #1 record, but it&rsquo;s cool to experience people knowing your music and the lyrics to your songs, singing them back to you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. Growing up that&rsquo;s what I wanted, and now it&rsquo;s happening for real.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DylanScott_8_31_51_AM_2_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dylanscottcountry\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dylanscottcountry\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/78YqeIji3mgAS2K1Maca6x"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dylanscottcntry"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/dylanscottcountry.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DylanScottCountry"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"02\/21\/2019 08:33:22 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jacob-latimore":{"id":"5977","name":"Jacob Latimore","friendly_url":"jacob-latimore","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>Jacob Latimore is excited to be back on stage again, especially his hometown Milwaukee.

I was doing some of my earliest songs, &lsquo;Ben McCullough&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Mercenary Song.&rsquo; But he was in the pool room and when I go in there the first thing he says to me is `I like your hat.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While it was a pretty cool hat, Earle remembers, &ldquo;worn in just right with some beads I fixed up around it,&rdquo; Clark did eventually hear his songs. A few months later he was playing bass in Guy&rsquo;s band.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now, I am a terrible bass player...but I was the kid, and that was what the kid did. I took over for Rodney Crowell. At that time Gordon Lightfoot&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&rsquo; was a top ten hit, which was amazing, a six and half minute story song on the radio. So Guy said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re story song writers, why not us?&rsquo; So we went out to cash in on the big wave.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The success of &lsquo;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&rsquo; was not replicated, but Earle reports that being the 19-year-old bass player in Guy Clark&rsquo;s band was &ldquo;a gas.&rdquo; At least until Earle went into a bar and left the bass in the back seat of his VW bug, from which it was promptly stolen. &ldquo;It was a nice Fender Precision bass that belonged to Guy, the kind of thing that would be worth ten grand now. He wasn&rsquo;t so happy about that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>More than forty years later, Steve Earle, just turned 64, no longer wears a cowboy hat. &ldquo;It was more than all the hat acts,&rdquo; Steve contended. &ldquo;My grandmother told me it was impolite to wear a hat indoors.&rdquo; As for Guy Clark, he&rsquo;s dead, passed away in 2016 after a decade long stare-downwith lymphoma. But Earle wasn&rsquo;t ready to stop thinking about his friend and mentor.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;No way I could get out of doing this record,&rdquo; Steve said when we talked over the phone from Charlotte, North Carolina, that night&rsquo;s stop on Earle&rsquo;s ever peripatetic road dog itinerary. &ldquo;When I get to the other side, I didn&rsquo;t want to run into Guy having made the TOWNES record and not one about him.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Townes van Zandt (subject of Earle&rsquo;s 2009 Townes) and Guy Clark were &ldquo;like Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg to me,&rdquo; Steve said. The mercurial Van Zandt (1944-1997) who once ordered his teenage disciple to chain him to a tree in hopes that it would keep him from drinking, was the On The Road quicksilver of youth. Clark, 33 at the time Earle met him, was a longer lasting, more mellow burn.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When it comes to mentors, I&rsquo;m glad I had both,&rdquo; Earle said. &ldquo;If you asked Townes what&rsquo;s it all about, he&rsquo;d hand you a copy of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. If you asked Guy the same question, he&rsquo;d take out a piece of paper and teach you how to diagram a song, what goes where. Townes was one of the all-time great writers, but he only finished three songs during the last fifteen years of his life. Guy had cancer and wrote songs until the day he died...He painted, he built instruments, he owned a guitar shop in the Bay Area where the young Bobby Weir hung out. He was older and wiser. You hung around with him and knew why they call what artists do<br \/>disciplines. Because he was disciplined.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;GUY wasn&rsquo;t really a hard record to make,&rdquo; Earle said. &ldquo;We did it fast, five or six days with almost no overdubbing. I wanted it to sound live...When you&rsquo;ve got a catalog like Guy&rsquo;s and you&rsquo;re only doing sixteen tracks, you know each one is going to be strong.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When he was making TOWNES, Earle recorded &ldquo;Pancho and Lefty&rdquo; first; it was a big record, covered over by no less than Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Bob Dylan. &ldquo;You had to go into the bar and right away knock out the biggest guy in the room,&rdquo; Earle recalled.<\/p>\n<p>With GUY it was a different process. Clark didn&rsquo;t have that one career-defining hit, but he wasn&rsquo;t exactly unknown. &ldquo;Desperados,&rdquo; &ldquo;LA Freeway&rdquo; were pre-&ldquo;Americana&rdquo; style hits. &ldquo;New Cut Road&rdquo; charted for Bobby Bare and was recorded by Johnny Cash. &ldquo;Heartbroke&rdquo; was a # 1 countryrecord for Ricky Skaggs in 1982. But when you added it up, Clark&rsquo;s songs wove together into variegated life tapestry, far more than the sum of the parts.<\/p>\n<p>Earle and his current, perhaps best ever, bunch of Dukes take on these songs with a spirit of reverent glee and invention. The tunes are all over the place and so is the band, offering max energy on such disparate entries as the bluegrass rave-up &ldquo;Sis Draper&rdquo; and talking blues memoir of &ldquo;Texas 1947.&rdquo; Earle&rsquo;s raw vocal on the sweet, sad &ldquo;That Old Time Feeling&rdquo; is heartbreaking, sounding close enough to the grave as to be doing a duet with his dead friend.<\/p>\n<p>You can hear little hints of where Earle came from. The stark &ldquo;Randall Knife&rdquo; has the line &ldquo;a better blade that was ever made was probably forged in Hell,&rdquo; which wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place in a Steve Earle song. Also hard to beat is &ldquo;The Last Gunfighter,&rdquo; a sardonic western saga to which Earle offers a bravura reading of the chorus: &ldquo;the smell of the black powder smoke and the stand in the street at the turn of joke.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But in the end GUY leads the listener back to its beginning, namely Guy Clark, which is what any good &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; should do.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, it was a revelation to dial up a video of Guy Clark singing &ldquo;Desperados Waiting For A Train&rdquo; on Austin City Limits sometime in the 1980&rsquo;s. Looking as handsome as any man ever was in his bluegrass suit and still brown, flowing hair, Clark sings of a relationship between a young man and an older friend. Saying how the elder man &ldquo;taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to,&rdquo; the young narrator describes a halcyon fantasy in which he and friend were always &ldquo;desperados waiting for a train.&rdquo; As time passes, however, the young man despairs. To him, his friend is &ldquo;one on the heroes of this country.&rdquo; So why is he &ldquo;dressed up like some old man?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Steve Earle delivers these lines well, as he always does. But the author of &ldquo;Guitar Town,&rdquo; &ldquo;Copperhead Road,&rdquo; &ldquo;Transcendental Blues&rdquo; and a hundred more masterpiece songs, would be the first to tell you it is one thing to perform &ldquo;Desperados Waiting For Train&rdquo; and another to be its creator. There are plenty of covers better than the original. But &ldquo;Desperados...&rdquo; will forever reside with Guy Clark, the songwriter singing his song, just him and his guitar. That is the main thing GUY has to tell you: to remember the cornerstone, never forget where you came from.<\/p>\n<p>There was another reason, Earle said, he couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get out of&rdquo; making GUY. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you live your life, you pile up these regrets. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of things that might be regrettable, but most of them I don&rsquo;t regret because I realize I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything else at the time.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;With GUY, however, there was this thing. When he was sick---he was dying really for the last ten years of his life---he asked me if we could write a song together. We should do it &lsquo;for the grandkids,&rsquo; he said. Well, I don&rsquo;t know...at the time, I still didn&rsquo;t co-write much, then I got busy. Then Guy died and it was too late. That, I regret.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Earle didn&rsquo;t think making GUY paid off some debt, as if it really could. Like the Townes record, Guy is a saga of friendship, its ups and downs, what endures. It is lucky for us that Earle remembers and honors these things, because like old friends, GUY is a diamond.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SteveEarle_9_46_43_AM_1_18_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 27 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SteveEarleMusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/steveearle\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2UBTfUoLI07iRqGeUrwhZh?si=HfJAKpG0R9uMuFuNjvU5ow"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SteveEarle"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.steveearle.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/SteveEarleVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/03\/2019 03:55:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dark-star-orchestra":{"id":"4932","name":"Dark Star Orchestra","friendly_url":"dark-star-orchestra","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Performing to critical acclaim celebrating their 20th anniversary year in 2017 and over 2600 shows, Dark Star Orchestra continues the Grateful Dead concert experience. Their shows are built off the Dead&rsquo;s extensive catalog and the talent of these seven fine musicians. On any given night, the band will perform a show based on a set list from the Grateful Dead's 30 years of extensive touring or use their catalog to program a unique set list for the show. This allows fans both young and old to share in the experience. By recreating set lists from the past, and by developing their own sets of Dead songs, Dark Star Orchestra offers a continually evolving artistic outlet within this musical canon. Honoring both the band and the fans, Dark Star Orchestra&rsquo;s members seek out the unique style and sound of each era while simultaneously offering their own informed improvisations.<\/p>\n<p>Dark Star Orchestra offers much more than the sound of the Grateful Dead, they truly encapsulate the energy and the experience. It's about a sense of familiarity. It's about a feeling that grabs listeners and takes over. It's about that contagious energy... in short, it's about the complete experience and consistent quality show that the fan receives when attending a Dark Star Orchestra show.<\/p>\n<p>Dark Star Orchestra has performed throughout the entire United States, plus Europe &amp; the Caribbean touching down in seven different countries. DSO continues to grow its fan base by playing at larger venues for two and even three night stands as well as performing at major music festivals including Bonnaroo, Milwaukee&rsquo;s SummerFest, The Peach Music Festival, All Good Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Mountain Jam, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to appearing at some of the nation&rsquo;s top festival, Dark Star Orchestra hosts its own annual music festival and campaign gathering, titled the &lsquo;Dark Star Jubilee&rsquo;, currently in its sixth year where DSO headline all three nights and are joined by a mix of established and up and coming national touring acts. Beyond the shores of the United States, DSO has taken its internationally-acclaimed Grateful Dead tribute to the beaches of Jamaica in the dead of winter for the past five years, with their event appropriately titled &lsquo;Jam in the Sand&rsquo;. Featuring an ocean-side stage, DSO sets up camp to perform shows for four nights along the tropical sands of an all-inclusive resort, selling out the event each year for hundreds of lucky attendees.<\/p>\n<p>Fans and critics haven&rsquo;t been the only people caught up in the spirit of a Dark Star show. The band has featured guest performances from six original Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Donna Jean Godchaux- MacKay, Vince Welnick, Tom Constanten and even toured with longtime Dead soundman, Dan Healy. Other notable guests have included Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman of Phish, Keller Williams, Warren Haynes, Steve Kimock, Peter Rowan, Ramblin&rsquo; Jack Elliot and many more.<\/p>\n<p>\"For us it's a chance to recreate some of the magic that was created for us over the years,\" rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rob Eaton explains. \"We offer a sort of a historical perspective at what it might have been like to go to a show in 1985, 1978 or whenever. Even for Deadheads who can say they've been to a hundred shows in the 90s, we offer something they never got to see live.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DarkStarOrchestra_3_09_33_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 6 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 6","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/darkstarorchestra\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.darkstarorchestra.net\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/darkstarorch"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/darkstarorchestra\/videos"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/darkstarorchestra\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4VjljDo2biBRVJ1WEXZ8GE"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/19\/2019 03:11:29 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"brother-ali":{"id":"5112","name":"Brother Ali","friendly_url":"brother-ali","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<div class=\"grid\">\n<div class=\"bio text-content intro\">\n<p>Over the past 17 years, Brother Ali has earned wide critical acclaim for his deeply personal, socially conscious, and inspiring brand of hip-hop.

Along with channeling the raw passion she first ignited by playing in rock bands in her homeland of New Jersey,&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>&nbsp;expands on the melodic ingenuity displayed in recent singles like &ldquo;Driving&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thrills.&rdquo; Above all the album is a testament to the sheer force of Missal&rsquo;s voice, a dynamic but delicate instrument that achieves a beautifully nuanced expression even as she belts her heart out.<\/p>\n<p>With its title taken from a track Missal co-wrote with her frequent collaborator Sharon Van Etten,&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>&nbsp;is an uncompromisingly honest look at living entirely on your own terms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life being hyper-focused on time, which I think is something that a lot of women obsess over,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in such a rush to make things happen, when really we should take the time to figure out what we actually want out of life. And even though it&rsquo;s so fucking hard to have that kind of patience, I think it&rsquo;s so important to believe in yourself enough to let things develop in a way that feels right to you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Produced by Tim Anderson (Solange, BANKS, Halsey),&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>&nbsp;matches that defiant spirit with a sound inspired by the rule-bending sensibilities of mixtape culture. Blending elements of soul and hip-hop and rock-and-roll, Missal shaped&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>&rsquo;s sonic landscape partly by laying live recordings down on tape, then sampling those recordings to imbue her songs with a fresh yet timeless energy. Much of that live recording took place at the iconic Different Fur Studios in San Francisco, with the sessions headed up by Missal and Nate Mercereau (a musician known for his work with Leon Bridges). &ldquo;I really wanted this album to reference my history of playing in bands,&rdquo; Missal points out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all these very pure, talented musicians playing together in a room, but then we took that and sampled it and altered in a way that creates something totally new.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the album, Missal brings her time-warping but gracefully arranged sound to songs that capture the most specific of emotions. Crafting her lyrics with the kind of idiosyncratic detail that instantly etches each line onto your heart, Missal explores self-empowerment on tracks like &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo;&mdash;a fiercely charged anthem about &ldquo;having the courage to take what you want from life, without apology.&rdquo; On &ldquo;Thrills,&rdquo; with its softly swaying groove and dreamy guitar tones, Missal&rsquo;s voice soars and shatters as she muses on self-love and sexual confidence. &ldquo;&lsquo;Thrills&rsquo; is about owning what makes you real,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;There is a shift happening in our societal standards of beauty and sexuality, and the more we embrace our flaws the closer we become to effecting real change. I&rsquo;d love for people to hear the song &mdash; and not just women, but anyone who feels disenfranchised&mdash; and remember that being sexy and confident comes from self-acceptance.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere on&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>, Missal infuses social commentary into songs like &ldquo;Girl&rdquo;: a stripped-back yet intricately textured track that unfolds with both gentle playfulness and piercing vulnerability. &ldquo;I wanted to address this idea that women need to be pinned against each other in order to succeed, or need to point out the flaws in other women just to feel good about themselves,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;That kind of thinking has been around forever, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going away&mdash;but the more we talk about it, the better it&rsquo;s going to get.&rdquo; And on &ldquo;Driving,&rdquo; Missal delivers one of the album&rsquo;s most mesmerizing moments, with her flowing melody, hypnotic rhythms, and ethereal vocals merging with a quiet grandeur that&rsquo;s simultaneously escapist and inspiring. &ldquo;&lsquo;Driving&rsquo; is about being on the precipice of taking control over your life&mdash;that feeling of seeing something you want in the distance and making the decision to go for it,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about saying &lsquo;Even if it takes a long time, or I hit some bumps along the way, it&rsquo;s all okay because I&rsquo;m the one behind the wheel.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>From song to song on&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>, Missal shows a natural musicality she credits to her father, a former session drummer and songwriter who ran his own studio in Manhattan. Born in New York, Missal moved with her family to New Jersey as a kid, and grew up playing with the vintage microphones and 16-track tape machine her dad kept in the basement. &ldquo;Every year he&rsquo;d have us make Christmas albums for my grandparents,&rdquo; recalls Missal, who&rsquo;s one of six children. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d go out and buy these instrumental CDs of Christmas songs and he&rsquo;d record us singing over it, and as we got older we moved onto making our own arrangements and playing the instruments ourselves,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;It was my first experience in singing and I just fell in love with it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When Missal was 10, her parents enrolled her and her siblings in a summer program at a local community theater, mainly as a way for the home-schooled family to interact with other kids. That program immediately sparked a love of performance in Missal, and helped her to develop the remarkable vocal range that now gives her music so much vitality. During her high school years she joined a theater program at a vocational school in a nearby town, but decided against furthering her education at a conservatory. &ldquo;I was looking at all these schools that cost up to 40 thousand dollars a semester, and it just didn&rsquo;t feel right,&rdquo; Missal says. &ldquo;Senior year I told my teacher that I didn&rsquo;t think that was my path, so he graduated me four months early, and then I joined a rock band.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Missal stuck with her band for several years, first playing basement shows around New Jersey and later booking gigs in Manhattan. As the band&rsquo;s lyricist, she discovered a deep love of songwriting, and dedicated herself to honing her craft. Eventually moving to Brooklyn, Missal balanced her time between bartending and writing, and soon came up with &ldquo;Keep Lying&rdquo;&mdash;a soulful slow-burner showcasing her full-throated vocal delivery. &ldquo;At the time I was struggling to understand what I wanted to do with my music,&rdquo; says Missal. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have the confidence yet to stand behind my vision, so I thought I could get other artists to cut my songs and just thrive that way.&rdquo; Although she&rsquo;d initially planned to use &ldquo;Keep Lying&rdquo; as part of her effort to score a publishing deal, Missal ultimately self-released the demo and landed it in the hands of Zane Lowe, who premiered it on Beats 1 (and, in turn, helped push the demo to the top of Spotify&rsquo;s Viral charts).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While record companies quickly came calling, Missal decided to focus on refining her vision, in part by working with a series of co-writers and producers. After finding a strong creative chemistry with Tim Anderson, she moved to L.A. and brought&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>&nbsp;to life by way of a deliberately unhurried process. &ldquo;I allowed myself a lot of time to figure out what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it, and because of all that I ended up making a record that really reflects who I am,&rdquo; she notes.<\/p>\n<p>Having signed her deal with Harvest Records in early 2018, Missal has also recently appeared as a featured artist on Macklemore&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>GEMINI<\/em>, written songs for the Netflix original series&nbsp;<em>The Get Down<\/em>, and supported K.Flay at a pair of sold-out shows. And with the release of&nbsp;<em>This Time<\/em>, one of her greatest hopes is for the album to impart the same sense of self-discovery that informed its creation. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a record about love and loss and relationships,&rdquo; Missal says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about taking chances for yourself, figuring out who you are and really standing behind that. I made a point of putting myself out there as a real person navigating this life at this moment in time, because I want to do whatever I can as an artist to help people feel more confident in navigating their own lives. I&rsquo;d love for the listener to receive the message that you can take your time to learn and love yourself. That&rsquo;s been the most important discovery that I want to share with this album.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DonnaMissal_7_21_55_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 27 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 27","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/donnamissalmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/donnamissal\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4QFHHdZkeqmneDQqKIjAN8"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/donnamissal"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.donnamissal.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCbQyZ-fOiu9IG1QNcFoossQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:06:00 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"shaed":{"id":"5039","name":"SHAED","friendly_url":"shaed","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>Based in Washington D.C., electro-pop trio SHAED balance effervescence and atmosphere.

When two kindred spirits cross paths 4,249 miles away from each other, magic still feels like the best possible explanation how&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>Flora Cash emerged at such an intersection. As the story goes, Minneapolis native Cole Randall uploaded his music to Soundcloud. Across the Atlantic, Shpresa Lleshaj stumbled upon his account and started leaving comments under the songs. Facebook messages gave way to an introductory phone conversation, which snowballed into marathon Skype sessions.<\/p>\n<p>Within months, Shpresa booked a ticket to Minneapolis. The two soulmates met I.R.L., relocated to Sweden, spent three months renting a room in a London flat due to Visa restrictions, and finally married back in the states. At the same time, the mystique of the music offset the exuberance of the union between them. The duo stitched together a singular style from threads of personal anxiety, struggle, and ultimately triumph.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that we&rsquo;re collaborating comes from our relationship, but there&rsquo;s more to our experience than the relationship,&rdquo; affirms Cole. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;re expressing ourselves individually and bringing those elements together within the band. We all lose people, endure hardships, and face issues. We want to talk about all of that in our music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reality, but there is a mystery,&rdquo; adds Shpresa.<\/p>\n<p>The mystery quietly intoxicated fans and gatekeepers alike. In 2017, their full-length debut,Nothing Lasts Forever (And It&rsquo;s Fine), attracted widespread tastemaker praise, including a coveted 9-out-of-10 score from Earmilk as well as acclaim from Noisey, Paste, Wonderland Magazine, Elmore Magazine and The Line of Best Fit, to name a few. The quiet grind paid off as the single &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Somebody Else&rdquo; went viral, clocked 7 million streams, topped HypeMachine, and attracted the attention of RCA Records.<\/p>\n<p>Upheld by acoustic guitars and ethereal production, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Somebody Else&rdquo; hinges on a gorgeously paranoid refrain, &ldquo;Well you look like yourself, but you&rsquo;re somebody else&mdash;only it ain&rsquo;t on the surface. Well you talk like yourself. No, I hear someone else though. Now you&rsquo;re making me nervous.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was going through a rough patch,&rdquo; admits Cole. &ldquo;It caused Shpresa to go through a rough patch. My anxiety got the best of the both of us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were staying in my sister&rsquo;s apartment where we recorded it,&rdquo; Shpresa elaborates. &ldquo;We lit a candle, Cole played a riff, and we developed this melody. It was like self-therapy for us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As they write more music in 2018, the story gets even deeper for Flora Cash.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for us to express what&rsquo;s inside,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s good, bad, or complicated, we just hope people feel something.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For open as Flora Cash may be, one key element will remain a secret&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really open about who we are, but we&rsquo;ve never told anyone the meaning of our name,&rdquo; smiles Cole. &ldquo;It was based on a conversation with someone close. Now I&rsquo;ve said more than I&rsquo;ve ever said to anyone,&rdquo; he laughs.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of Flora Cash.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_FloraCash_11_00_06_AM_3_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 28 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 28","start_time":"6:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/floracash.official"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/flora_cash\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6GpcBKNmZDIrRzYkPJu7Wd"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Flora_Cash"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.floracash.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCIxbNppa52neZxW8L2IXwMw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/24\/2019 11:08:19 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"robert-randolph--the-family-band":{"id":"4943","name":"Robert Randolph & The Family Band","friendly_url":"robert-randolph--the-family-band","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p>This record is a celebration of African-American music over the past one hundred years and its social messages from the last thirty. Although we cover a whole timeline of different eras on We Walk This Road, what ties these songs together remain their message of hope, their ability to uplift. After we finished our last record, Colorblind, we began searching for a great producer to help guide the follow up. We wanted someone who understood me and the road I&rsquo;ve walked this far, who understood our connections of my roots within rock and gospel and the church, who would help us put those things in their most compelling context. T Bone Burnett shared the vision of how gospel, blues and rock could be put together in a way that could relate to my history and connect to my present. It was important to us that we make the record we wanted to make, even if the end result was unclassifiable. We just focused on making great songs and great music that spoke to me, and that reflected the way I try to speak to the world. We recorded We Walk This Road over about two years, after T Bone had finished his record with Alison Krauss and Robert Plant. We went into the studio with virtual libraries of songs, whole volumes worth of material to go through. T Bone brought in old archival songs from the twenties and thirties and many of them were in the public domain. I had songs that I had written with the band, or that other artists had sent me, and we sat down and starting sifting through history. When we found something we liked, we would either cover it or re-work it using our own words or melodies. Through this creation came an education. T Bone opened a lot of doors for me serving as a link between the past and the present. He knows how to take something from the past and bring it into the present while still allowing the artist to make it his own, in the same way that Hendrix took Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;All Along the Watchtower&rdquo; and made it belong to him. T Bone listens to music that our grandmothers would listen to as children&ndash;not even music that our fathers listened to, but songs that go even further back&hellip;some from Gospel and Christian blues, the music that people working in fields across the south likely sang nearly a century ago. Those are the real roots of rock and roll, where everything else comes from. I was only allowed to listen to modern Christian and gospel music growing up, so there was so much I didn&rsquo;t know about. My mind is expanded now. The record is finished and I still feel as if I&rsquo;m not done. I&rsquo;ve spent over $5,000 on iTunes in the past eighteen months just catching up. Before this record, I didn&rsquo;t sift through music past the Seventies. I didn&rsquo;t know about Blind Willie Johnson, or Chess Records. I thank T Bone for being a tour guide into the deepest parts of my musical roots. We connected the last one hundred years of African-American music in the way people used to: You write your own songs, you cover other people&rsquo;s material, you re-work older songs. We had some amazing people come in to help. Leon Russell came by to hang out and wound up playing piano on the last track, &ldquo;Salvation.&rdquo; Ben Harper plays guitar and sings on &ldquo;If I Had My Way.&rdquo; The base of that song came from Blind Willie Johnson, and it was really difficult to get right. It was a country tune for a while. I had honestly given up on it. But Ben came down and said, &ldquo;Let me get in there! I know just what to do!&rdquo; He went in there and smoked the choruses, and I thought, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got a tune.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s one of my favorite songs on the record. Where We&rsquo;ve Been I grew up in the House of God church. The pedal steel was a big part of our church tradition. I grew up watching older guys play, and I started playing when I was fifteen. When I was nineteen, someone gave me tickets to a Stevie Ray Vaughan concert. After that, I wanted to play pedal steel like Stevie Ray played his guitar. I wanted to take another path than the people who played traditional pedal steel to take it to a whole new level.We started playing and touring around New York City in 2000, playing clubs like Wetlands, and things started to take off. We were selling out large New York clubs with no record deal, and it started to spread to Philly and Boston. Soon, we signed to Warner Brothers, and word began to get around about us nationally. Great artists like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews and B.B. King accepted us. Young artists, too: we toured with the Roots and Pharrell and John Mayer. We have been fortunate to be accepted by a wide range of fan bases, and we have been able to build from there. I definitely feel as if everything has been working up to this moment, to this record. Where We&rsquo;re Going I&rsquo;m very excited to play these tracks live. Those people who have been our fans and followers should see the progression from our last record to this one, and the road we&rsquo;ve taken won&rsquo;t seem too foreign to them. When people come to see us, they know that it&rsquo;s really about the message, about making them feel good. Hopefully, this record will inspire them in the same way. It certainly makes me feel happy. I can&rsquo;t see myself recording depressing lyrics, lyrics that leave people without a sense of hope. It&rsquo;s not in me to use the power of the microphone to makemusic like that. That&rsquo;s why this record is uplifting - it&rsquo;s got great messages. It&rsquo;s all there.My goal is to open the door for people, in the same way that musical doors have been opened for me. I want to take this musical history and make it relevant to give people a better idea of who I am and where I came from. I think even though I&rsquo;m a young guy who was born into the era of hip-hop and contemporary gospel, I can help bridge the cultural gap between people who are seventy-five years old and kids who are fifteen years old by reaching back into this history of music.We Walk This Road was done in our belief in what we all need right now: young voices saying something positive without preaching in hopes of inspiring people. When you stick to what you believe in, and with the roots of where you come from, things will always work out.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_RobertRandolphTheFamilyBand_3_48_49_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rrtfb"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.robertrandolph.net\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rrtfb"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/rrtfb"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rrtfb\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4xac3zhHlBm5QDxbZeqgeR"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/07\/2019 04:45:14 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"voil":{"id":"5283","name":"VOIL\u00c0","friendly_url":"voil","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<p>\"Refreshing,\" \"Romantic,\" and \"Relatable\" are a few of the terms used to describe L.A.- based pop\/rock act VOIL&Agrave;.

Aggressive music is often fueled by youthful fire, and sustaining a career without completely abandoning that urgent sound is almost impossible for most bands. But what&rsquo;s possible for \"most bands&rdquo; has never been a concern for post-hardcore pioneers Silverstein. Throughout the course of their 17-year career, from Ontario basement shows to touring the world and selling over a million records, Silverstein has always managed to be completely comfortable in their own skin while never being afraid to challenge themselves. This perfect balance marks the band&rsquo;s eighth full-length, <em>Dead Reflection&mdash;<\/em>an album that proves Silverstein still has plenty of fire left.<\/p>\n<p>Silverstein have released an album every odd year since their 2003 debut, <em>When Broken Is Easily Fixed<\/em>, and that drive is paramount to why the band remains one of post-hardcore&rsquo;s most relevant and influential acts. This consistency shows an uncommonly clear path of growth from album to album as the band honed the aggressive-to-melodic contrast that became their signature<\/p>\n<p>sound. <em>Dead Reflection <\/em>marks a sharp jump in that evolution: the band pushed themselves harder than ever before, resulting in an album the takes all of Silverstein's strengths&mdash;pummeling riffs, explosive dynamic shifts, and huge, anthemic choruses&mdash;and ramps up the intensity. Guitarist Paul Marc Rousseau co-produced <em>Dead Reflection <\/em>with Derek Hoffman, leading to a level of collaboration with which band had never experimented before. After years of creating and touring, the members of Silverstein have each become accomplished musicians in their own right while still summoning the same unbridled ferocity that marked the band&rsquo;s early days, and it&rsquo;s this fusion that makes <em>Dead Reflection <\/em>feel so vital.<\/p>\n<p>Vocalist Shane Told has always been a master of taking his darkest times and channeling them into compelling songwriting, and <em>Dead Reflection <\/em>ups the ante as the singer documents his most troubled year. The tumultuous end of a long relationship sent Told into a self-destructive spiral that left him isolated and forced to confront who he truly was with everything stripped away. All of the positivity that had previously come so easily suddenly felt put-on, like a costume that never quite fit, and as the people closest to him were all entering new phases of life with new responsibilities, the singer found himself feeling more alone and nihilistic than ever. In the end it was Silverstein, the one constant in Told's life, that brought him back from the brink. With the prospect of writing a new album on the horizon, he threw himself into the process, fully exploring the bleak narrative he was living out. <em>Dead Reflection <\/em>became a sort of &ldquo;What-if?\" version of Told's life, a cautionary tale urging listeners to find out what really matters and challenge their own masks before it's too late. Writing proved to be as cathartic as it was harrowing, and slowly Told began to feel the weight of the past year lifting; Silverstein had been there for him just when he needed it most.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dead Reflection <\/em>is an album that couldn't exist without everything that's come before it, a culmination not just of Silverstein's sonic growth, but also the personal journeys entangled in the band&rsquo;s<\/p>\n<p>career. Longevity was never the objective, but that drive to deliver their absolute best, no matter what the cost, is exactly why the band remains at the top of their game after almost two decades. For Silverstein there is no settling, no stopping, and they give nothing less than everything.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Silverstein_2_55_55_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 29 - 8:45 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 29","start_time":"8:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/silversteinmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/silverstein\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1Tsag5J854qxeOo2apszug"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/silverstein"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/silversteinmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/SilversteinOfficial"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/26\/2019 08:25:50 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"guided-by-voices":{"id":"4931","name":"Guided By Voices","friendly_url":"guided-by-voices","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p><strong>Guided By Voices, Space Gun<\/strong>: Robert Pollard is the greatest rock songwriter of the last thirty years, an uninhibited explorer of the four Ps: pop, punk, psych, and prog.

If you haven't seen them live, I can't recommend it enough -- they hit you with one would-be smash hit after another on a Miller Lite-fueled high, which can ensnare even on-the-fence observers.<br \/><br \/>- Ben Yakas, Gothamist<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GuidedByVoices_8_36_24_AM_2_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GuidedByVoicesOfficial"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/instagbv\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4oV5EVJ0XFWsJKoOvdRPvl"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_GuidedByVoices"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.guidedbyvoices.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/GBVRobertPollard"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/29\/2019 04:12:11 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jesus-jones":{"id":"5216","name":"Jesus Jones","friendly_url":"jesus-jones","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>Jesus Jones are back &ndash; but to be strictly accurate, they never actually went away.

After releasing a couple of albums of straight-ahead Southern boogie, the band revamped its sound to fall halfway between country-fried blues-rock and driving, arena-ready hard rock. The result was a string of hit albums and singles in the early '80s, highlighted by \"Caught Up in You,\" \"If I'd Been the One,\" \"Back Where You Belong,\" and \"Like No Other Night.\" .38 Special's popularity dipped in the late '80s as MTV-sponsored pop and heavy metal cut into their audience. Though the band had its biggest hit in 1989 with the ballad \"Second Chance,\" it proved to be their last gasp -- they faded away in the early '90s, retiring to the oldies circuit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArtistAbout__paragraph\" dir=\"auto\">Donnie Van Zant (vocals) formed the Jacksonville, FL-based .38 Special in 1975 with Jeff Carlisi (guitar), Don Barnes (guitar, vocals), Ken Lyons (bass), Jack Grondin (drums), and Steve Brookins (drums). Two years later, the band signed with A&amp;M Records and released its eponymous debut. Neither 38 Special or its follow-up, Special Delivery, received much attention, but the group began to build up a following through its constant touring. Bassist Lyons left before the recording of 1979's Rockin' Into the Night, the album that demonstrated a more melodic, driving sound; he was replaced by Larry Junstrom. Rockin' Into the Night became a moderate hit, but 1981's Wild-Eyed Southern Boys was a genuine hit, going platinum and generating the Top 40 \"Hold On Loosely.\" Special Forces, released in 1982, was even more popular, spawning the Top Ten single \"Caught Up in You.\" Tour de Force (1983) and Strength in Numbers (1986) were both successes, and the band continued to be a popular touring outfit. Barnes and Brookins left in 1987; Barnes was replaced by Danny Chauncey.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArtistAbout__paragraph\" dir=\"auto\">While Strength in Numbers had been popular, it didn't stay on the charts as long as its predecessors. Flashback, the 1987 greatest-hits album, was moderately successful, but the band took precautions to retain its audience by recording the polished Rock &amp; Roll Strategy. Released in 1989, the album slowly became a hit on the strength of \"Second Chance,\" an adult contemporary-oriented ballad that reached the Top Ten. Rock &amp; Roll Strategy became the band's final big hit. Barnes returned to the band in 1991 and the group added drummer Scott Hoffman and keyboardist Bobby Capps. Even with the extensive retooling and the support of a new label, Charisma, 1991's Bone Against Steel failed to gain much attention. .38 Special didn't release another album for six years. In the summer of 1997, they released a comeback effort titled Resolution on Razor &amp; Tie Records. Live at Sturgis followed on CMC in 1999. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_38Special_3_57_38_PM_3_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/38Special?sk=wall"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/38special.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/38SpecialMedia"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/38specialvideos"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/38specialband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3zXw2Eh96iTT51pytzHdZi"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/18\/2019 02:12:10 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dumpstaphunk":{"id":"5106","name":"Dumpstaphunk","friendly_url":"dumpstaphunk","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Dumpstaphunk stands out among New Orleans' best as one of the funkiest bands to ever arise from the Crescent City. Born on the Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville's funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly &amp; the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like \"Dancin' To The Truth\" off their latest record, Dirty Word (July 30, 2013, Louisiana Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.<br \/><br \/>\"I don't expect to hear anything funkier this year.\" -&nbsp;<strong><em>Jon Pareles<\/em><\/strong><em>,&nbsp;<strong>New York Times<\/strong><\/em><br \/><br \/>\"[A] jackpot of a funk record from Dumpstaphunk.\" -&nbsp;<em><strong>WNYC<\/strong><\/em><br \/><br \/>\"Dumpstaphunk's self-produced sonic approach feels live, nasty, and greasy.

Songs written during the group&rsquo;s inception are as relevant and inventive today as they were in 1977.<br \/> <br \/> The fact is, no one sounds like X and no one ever will.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising when you consider the group&rsquo;s unique beginnings, which can only be attributed to fate. On the same day with nearly the exact same wording, two want-ads appear in a local music rag. One was sent in by a guitarist named Billy Zoom, the other by bassist who called himself John Doe.<\/p>\n<p>Zoom, a rockabilly rebel who&rsquo;d performed with Gene Vincent, had read a negative review of a band called the Ramones. It said they only played three chords and they played &lsquo;em too fast. So naturally, he went to see them. The show was at the Golden West Ballroom in the L.A. suburb of Norwalk in early &rsquo;77, and as soon as the Ramones started to perform, Zoom realized that, musically, he&rsquo;d found exactly what he wanted to do with his life.<\/p>\n<p>Doe, who was originally from the Baltimore area, was already down with the East Coast CBGB&rsquo;s scene and by the time the two got in the same room together after responding to each other&rsquo;s ads, it seemed it was meant to be. They performed a few shows with various drummers before a poet with no ambition of being a singer would enter the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Doe found her in Venice Beach, at a poetry reading. He liked her poems so much he offered to perform them in his band. The poet, Exene Cervenka, had just moved to town from Florida and she told him, no offense, but if anyone was gonna perform her poems, it would be her, and she soon ended up in the band. Zoom was skeptical about someone&rsquo;s girlfriend being in the band. After they did their first show with Exene, he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it was she had, but he knew it was magic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After a succession of drummers, Doe was at the underground punk club the Masque in Hollywood one night, checking out a band called the Eyes, which featured a pre-Go-Go&rsquo;s bass player named Charlotte Caffey. He called Zoom immediately and said he&rsquo;d found their drummer. Doe told him he played with a parade snare and hit it hard as a hammer. Zoom told him to promise him anything. His name was D.J. Bonebrake and he quickly signed on. The band was now complete, and X would soon emerge from the young punk scene as one of its most successful offspring.<\/p>\n<p>The band&rsquo;s early albums, Los Angeles (1980), produced by Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Wild Gift (1981), and Under the Big Black Sun (1982) explored dark love and an even darker L.A. with the unflinching eye of a Raymond Chandler novel. Doe and Cervenka would marry and later divorce, but they&rsquo;d always remain soulmates. As they released each ensuing album, More Fun in theNew World(1983) and Ain&rsquo;t Love Grand (1985), the band continued to grow sonically and politically, fearlessly mixing genres without ever losing its center. As each member went on to explore diverse careers&mdash;careers that included acting, art, writing, producing and multiple side projects.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_X_7_33_06_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/X-the-band-37877887019\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/xthebandofficial\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.xtheband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC6q-RDYzhaUnZmI4WJXaJTA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:07:23 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"nora-collins":{"id":"4987","name":"Nora Collins","friendly_url":"nora-collins","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>Nora Collins brings a confident and youthful originality to country music &ndash; a style she describes as &ldquo;fun, flirty, relatable and honest.&rdquo; That individuality is evident in &ldquo;Who Knows Who,&rdquo; a catchy single that captures her energetic spirit and her talent for songwriting.<\/p>\n<p>Already her dynamic music has gained the attention of CMT, Radio Disney, and the iconic music festival Summerfest in Milwaukee. In 2016, Collins played 18 Summerfest sets across 11 days. The following year, she opened for Lee Brice on the festival&rsquo;s main stage, which remains a landmark in her career.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being a Milwaukee girl this was a dream come true for me,&rdquo; says Collins, who was born and raised in nearby Brookfield, Wisconsin. &ldquo;That was the stage I grew up going to, to see my favorite bands play. In a way it made me feel like I am &lsquo;making it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed she is. Collins moved to Nashville in April 2016 after landing a publishing and artist development deal with MV2 Entertainment. She explains, &ldquo;I had never moved in my life until I moved to Nashville. It means so much to have my Wisconsin friends cheering me on. They have been so kind to me over the years. Wisconsin is a proud state that really rallies behind their own.&nbsp;I want nothing more than to make my hometown proud.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Collins has claimed the Best of Milwaukee Award in the Female Vocalist category four times (2013-2016). She also earned recognition as Best Acoustic Musician in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In addition, she has received eight Wisconsin Area Music Industry Award (WAMI) nominations, leading to wins as Singer\/Songwriter of the Year in 2014 and Rising Star in 2012 and 2013.<\/p>\n<p>A frequent local performer from the time she was 14 years old, Collins has gradually accumulated a stack of independent albums to sell at her shows. After co-writing with several notable Nashville songwriters, she released a five-song EP with MV2 in 2016, followed by a Christmas project in 2017. She is currently working on new music with accomplished producer Marshall Altman (Natasha Bedingfield, Amy Grant, Frankie Ballard, Eric Paslay).<\/p>\n<p>She notes, &ldquo;Having a hit producer connect with my songs and want to help me bring them to life was a big honor. It&rsquo;s been so fun working with him. It&rsquo;s amazing to watch him work and learn from him.&rdquo; When Collins unveiled the uptempo single, &ldquo;Who Knows Who,&rdquo; CMT premiered the video while Radio Disney added the song to rotation.<\/p>\n<p>Collins says, &ldquo;The message of this song is that two can play that game. I feel like it&rsquo;s a really relatable song about the games we all can be guilty of playing in relationships. You want the person to know that you could be anywhere, doing anything without them and you&rsquo;re having the time of your life. You want them to be dying to know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In concert, Collins often accompanies herself on acoustic guitar, fitting in seamlessly with top-notch musicians that she&rsquo;s met in Nashville. She believes that the lively attitude of &ldquo;Who Knows Who&rdquo; sets the stage for the upcoming EP. &ldquo;A lot of the songs have a throwback feel, which showcases who some of my musical influences are,&rdquo; she says, citing Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton, Shania Twain, Alison Krauss, and Miranda Lambert as personal heroes. Dedicated to a career in music, Collins hopes to join their ranks.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have many goals but my ultimate goal since moving here is to have a hand in writing a No. 1 song, earn a major label record deal, go on tour as the opening act on a major tour, and have my own #1 song as the artist,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, like these women, she knows she has to work hard to be heard. It&rsquo;s a lesson she discovered through her Midwestern upbringing: &ldquo;I learned the importance of work ethic from my parents. They instilled in me that if you want something, you have to work for it.&nbsp;Always be the hardest worker in the room.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When she&rsquo;s off the road, Collins dedicates her time to co-writing sessions on Music Row. As she continues to garner new fans through performances and social media, the naturally outgoing singer-songwriter believes that she is forging new friendships, too.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am most looking forward to going out on the road and playing my new music!\" she says. &ldquo;When people hear my music, my hope is that they will connect to the songs. There is nothing more special to me than knowing that my lyrics moved someone. Music is the universal language that connects us all and it's so cool to see that in action.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_NoraCollins_12_27_33_AM_6_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NoraCollinsOfficial\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/hhttps:\/\/www.noracollins.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/noracollins"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTM4VE2yH7mAL6yvhaH0dwg"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nora_collins\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2VQCul6BaaFxpL6lkZUxUg?si=Z4rhF2x-SmKPX3te-hqvnQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/20\/2019 01:26:08 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"ozomatli":{"id":"4976","name":"Ozomatli","friendly_url":"ozomatli","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, June 30","description":"<p>Since its inception in 1995, innovation and creativity have defined Ozomatli. Hailing from Los Angeles, the group found a way to represent the city's eclectic culture through music that appeals to the local community and the world beyond. Ozomatli's success is exemplified in an impressive variety of genres from classic to modern Latino, urban, hip-hop and other world styles. The \"Dioses del Baile,\" or \"Gods of Dance,\" have created one of the most exciting, captivating and flat-out fun live shows touring today. They continue to harness their musical instincts by conceiving new concepts and forging new sounds that keep fans on their toes and the world dancing.<\/p>\n<p>The latest recording is an album of classic Mexican hits reimagined with a reggae feel. Titled Non-Stop: Los Angeles ? Mexico ? Kingston, it pays homage to the band's Latin roots, allowing them to personalize songs that defined their youth and in turn, become part of Latin and Pop music lore. Produced by drum &amp; bass reggae legends, Sly &amp; Robbie (Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Madonna, No Doubt) and featuring various high profile guest vocalists, the album recreates the magic of classic Latin hits with a reggae dancehall vibe that only Ozomatli could make feel as natural as waves rolling in the Caribbean sands.<\/p>\n<p>The album was born from the group's desire to pay tribute to the Mexican styles that influenced their youth. Originally conceived as a tribute to mariachi and Norte&ntilde;o, the band decided to expand the concept and include old and new artists and cover more eras all under the umbrella of reggae. Pairing reggae dancehall instrumentals with the already eclectic variety of Mexican music spoke to the band's desire to do something uniquely authentic for its 20th anniversary. The album includes classic Mexican songs such as \"Sabor a Mi\" and \"Besame Mucho,\" but also songs by contemporary Mexican acts like Cafe Tacuba and Mana, Mexican-American greats like Selena, and classic legends like Santana. Ozomatli has always brought people and cultures together with their music and that is exactly what this album embodies, merging Jamaican influences with Mexican roots to lend an original Ozo sound to songs we all know.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to paying respects to the classic Latin catalogue, Ozomatli was creating its own repertoire adored by fans and critics alike. The band catapulted to the top of the live music scene with its first eponymously titled album. The impact of the then 10-piece band's album was felt throughout the music world, and earned them the opportunity to open for Carlos Santana on his Supernatural tour. Following the success of its first album and touring with Santana and Mana, Ozomatli released its sophomore album, Embrace the Chaos, which garnered a Grammy award for Best Latin Rock\/Alternative Album. The follow up album, Street Signs, won both the same award and the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>Ozomatli takes firm stances on various social justice issues. Their work focuses on giving voice to Latino culture, opportunity to children, fighting for workers' rights, and promoting global unity and peace amongst people, cultures and nations. Ozomatli were named Cultural Ambassadors for the U.S. State Department in 2006, was the first musical group to speak at the TED Conference in San Francisco, and performed for President and First Lady Obama at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 32nd Annual Award Gala.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to politics and social issues, Ozomatli emphasizes the importance of family and children. Ozomatli has strived to make music to be shared through the generations and have even recorded music specifically targeted towards children and families. Their 2012 release, Ozomatli Presents OzoKidz, features all original children's music that captures the innovation and liveliness that Ozo fans have become accustomed to, while educating children on the values of nature and knowledge. The band continues to perform the album at special OzoKidz concerts, where parents and children alike dance and play along on OzoKidz kazoos.<\/p>\n<p>With Non-Stop, Ozomatli continues creating music for entire families and communities. By recreating these classic Latin songs, Ozo redefines their meaning and reimagines their beauty for generations to come. As Ozomatli percussionist and MC, Justin Poree, puts it, \"Anyone who is eight or 80 will recognize \"Sabor a Mi\" or \"Besame Mucho.\" These rhythmically and melodically rich songs bridge the generational gap, captivate all who listen, and beautifully mesh a variety of rich cultures.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Ozomatli_3_29_22_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 30 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 30","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ozomatli"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ozomatli\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1An0HCtDktvCBDdFEu7HC0"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ozomatli"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/ozomatli.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/OzoVideos"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/06\/2019 02:10:34 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"mitchell-tenpenny":{"id":"5073","name":"Mitchell Tenpenny","friendly_url":"mitchell-tenpenny","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell a bunch of different stories on this album, but they all had to be authentic and believable to me,&rdquo; says Mitchell Tenpenny. &ldquo;What I was feeling at the time, where I was in my head, what&rsquo;s going on in the world, it all contributed to the end product. The songs that made it were the ones I was sure that I was passionate about getting on there&mdash;what I was proud of, what I really wanted to say.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On the heels of his RIAA-certified Gold single, &ldquo;Drunk Me,&rdquo; comes Tenpenny&rsquo;s major label debut album,&nbsp;<em>Telling All My Secrets<\/em>.&nbsp;Revealing a wide range of influences and a level of assurance and confidence that comes from already having years of songwriting and touring behind him, the record marks the arrival of an artist recently singled out by <em>Billboard<\/em> as a pick to &ldquo;break out&rdquo; by the end of 2018, and as one of Pandora&rsquo;s Artists to Watch in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these predictions aren&rsquo;t all that bold, since Tenpenny&rsquo;s first single and No. 1 hit &ldquo;Drunk Me&rdquo; has earned more than 120 million on-demand streams and surpassed 500,000 certifiable units in the U.S. <em>The New York Times<\/em> named it one of the best songs of 2018, and the singer claims that he knew the song was special as soon as he recorded it.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everything about it&mdash;the production, the hook, the performance&mdash;it felt like how I wanted to present myself,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We dug into that song and made it real cinematic and unusual. On the first playback, it felt like something Whitney Houston might do, and I thought, &lsquo;This is what we need to be doing, this feels right,&rsquo; and it became the foundation of the record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Not that you can ever anticipate the kind of explosive success that &ldquo;Drunk Me&rdquo; has had. &ldquo;You never know what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; says Tenpenny, &ldquo;but I was confident enough to be okay with it if it failed. I knew I gave it my best, gave it my all. That&rsquo;s something I learned playing football&mdash;my coach used to say that you can&rsquo;t be afraid to lose. So with this song, I could go in fearless.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That sense of clarity is largely a result of the relationship that the Nashville native had with his grandmother, industry veteran and the first female CEO of Sony\/ATV Music Publishing, Donna Hilley. &ldquo;I was very lucky,&rdquo; says Tenpenny. &ldquo;I got to grow up in this business, see it&mdash;I saw how my grandmother treated writers, and how important it was to the town. It&rsquo;s a small circle of friends in this industry, and she always treated people right.&rdquo; (This attitude also presumably helped Tenpenny in the album&rsquo;s collaborations with such stellar songwriters as Hillary Lindsey, Devin Dawson and Josh Hoge.)<\/p>\n<p>Tenpenny first picked up a guitar at the age of 13, and after graduating with a music business degree from Middle Tennessee State University, he began his professional career. The 2015 <em>Black Crow<\/em> album featured cameos from the SteelDrivers, Ace Frehley and Brian &ldquo;Head&rdquo; Welch from Korn. In 2017, his <em>Linden Ave.<\/em> EP made it to No. 6 on the <em>Billboard<\/em> &ldquo;Heatseekers&rdquo; chart.<\/p>\n<p>Concurrently, he was seeing success as a songwriter, most notably co-writing Granger Smith&rsquo;s Top 10 hit &ldquo;If the Boot Fits.&rdquo; Along the way, he has toured with the likes of Maren Morris, Jake Owen, Brett Young, Cole Swindell, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Dustin Lynch.<\/p>\n<p>Though most of the album was written since the completion of the <em>Mitchell Tenpenny<\/em> EP, a few of the songs go further back. &ldquo;I wrote &lsquo;Goner&rsquo; a long time ago,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of my favorites ever. I gave it my best John Mayer\/Michael Jackson impression&mdash;not that I ever thought, &lsquo;I want to sound like that,&rsquo; but I can hear my own experiences in there with a combination of the music I&rsquo;ve grown up with.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Tenpenny embraces the idea that he&rsquo;s part of a new generation of country artists who grew up listening to a diverse range of styles. &ldquo;I never gave much thought about which genre I am,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can hear rock, pop, gospel, but the lyrics always stay true to what I am, to Nashville. It would be inauthentic for me to try to be Hank or Waylon or Willie&mdash;I want to transform and keep creating, I want to hear new, exciting things. We have to be able to change sounds or we&rsquo;re going nowhere.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s final song, &ldquo;Walk Like Him,&rdquo; is the most personal track for Tenpenny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first song I wrote about my dad after his passing, and it took a few years,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My family all say that I really do walk like him. I remember I was driving back from a show in the van, the band was all asleep in the back, and it just hit me and I broke down&mdash;I wrote that hook that night. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get it off my chest for years, and I wanted the album to end on that emotion. I think anyone who has lost someone can understand the feeling.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The coming months will remain busy for Tenpenny. He just released \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&rdquo; for the holidays, will headline his 12-date <em>Telling All My Secrets Album Release Tour<\/em> from December through February, and has already been tapped as the opener for Old Dominion&rsquo;s <em>Make It Sweet Tour<\/em> in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The official line has been that Mitchell Tenpenny wrote 56 songs for the album that became <em>Telling All My Secrets<\/em>, his Riser House\/Columbia Nashville debut, but he admits that it was really several hundred, and that he can feel the growth in his work as he gains more experience. &ldquo;My writing is getting more mature, more honest,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re younger, you&rsquo;re afraid to sing a lot of things, but as you get older, that wall starts to fall down. I&rsquo;m talking about things that people my age are dealing with on a daily basis, and the best thing is to have that vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen more, traveled more, and you see the world and learn what people want. As you get older, you get a little wiser&mdash;I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m wise, but I&rsquo;m learning every day, and that comes out in the songs.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MitchellTenpenny_3_43_18_PM_3_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/m10penny"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/m10penny\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1p6CdzJRoicjRcSdWoB9Qc"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/m10penny"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.mitchell10penny.com\/home\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/tenpennyjm"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:08:22 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"10000-maniacs":{"id":"5029","name":"10,000 Maniacs","friendly_url":"10000-maniacs","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>10,000 Maniacs has a lot in common with Jamestown, New York, the city that spawned them back in 1981. Both are honest and hardworking, a step outside the mainstream, and both possess a bit of magic.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a city of blue-collar poetry,&rdquo; says keyboardist Dennis Drew. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re about, real-life stories. We&rsquo;re a family, we do real work and we keep moving forward.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The band has covered plenty of ground in its 35-plus years, from cult-herodom to international stardom, to their current status as a cornerstone alternative band. But the sound and spirit of 10,000 Maniacs remains consistent. The live shows embrace their entire catalogue, and the lineup is still anchored by four of the six original members. Drew and bassist Steven Gustafson cofounded the band in 1981, drummer Jerry Augustyniak came along shortly afterward, and founding guitarist\/singer John Lombardo, who&rsquo;d never completely left the picture, was welcomed back fulltime in 2015. And the two &ldquo;new&rdquo; members have long been part of the family: Mary Ramsey toured and recorded with the Maniacs as a viola player and backup singer before stepping into the front woman&rsquo;s role 24 years ago. And the new guy Jeff Erickson, the lead guitarist for a mere 17 years, came in at the behest of his friend and mentor, the late Rob Buck.<\/p>\n<p>The band was proudly eclectic from the start, making trademarks of wide-ranging music and poetic lyrics. The tribal-sounding &ldquo;My Mother the War,&rdquo; one of their most aggressive early tracks, hit college radio and briefly scraped the UK charts in 1984. Signed to Elektra the following year, the band worked with legendary producer Joe Boyd on&nbsp;<em>The Wishing Chair<\/em>&nbsp;and embraced its love of British folk-rock, a sound they&rsquo;d return to over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the more direct approach proved the charm, as the band played to ever-growing audiences (including a memorable tour with R.E.M.) and began writing its most enduring material. The late &lsquo;80s\/early &lsquo;90s found the band delivering a remarkable string of albums&mdash;1987&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>In My Tribe<\/em>&nbsp;and 1989&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Blind Man&rsquo;s Zoo<\/em>, both produced by the legendary Peter Asher, and 1992&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Our Time in Eden<\/em>, produced by Paul Fox. From these albums came the hits &ldquo;Like the Weather,&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Matter Here?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Trouble Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;These Are Days,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Candy Everybody Wants&rdquo;&mdash;all among the more thoughtful and beautifully crafted singles of their time.<\/p>\n<p>Founding singer Natalie Merchant went solo in 1993. &ldquo;We love Natalie, we love her and the time we spent with her was very special,&rdquo; says Drew today. Meanwhile founding member John Lombardo had also split the lineup and had formed a new duo, John &amp; Mary. When 10,000 Maniacs toured in 1991 behind the&nbsp;<em>Hope Chest<\/em>&nbsp;album (a reissue of their earliest EP&rsquo;s), it made sense for Lombardo to temporarily rejoin, and to bring his new musical partner along.<\/p>\n<p>Ramsey proved a perfect fit and added her voice and strings to the later part of the Natalie era, including the MTV Unplugged show that spawned their hit cover of the Patti Smith\/Bruce Springsteen song &ldquo;Because the Night.&rdquo; So when Merchant gave her notice, there was little question of who would step in. &ldquo;The style of music came very naturally to me,&rdquo; Ramsey says. &ldquo;I had that familiarity with the band, and I&rsquo;m from Fredonia, in the same part of western New York.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The new lineup debuted on 1997&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Love Among the Ruins<\/em>, a well-received album that included their gorgeous cover of Roxy Music&rsquo;s &ldquo;More Than This&rdquo;&mdash;a productive era that also produced a strong follow up album two years later,&nbsp;<em>The Earth Pressed Flat<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But the band was dealt a blow the following year with the death of Rob Buck. An innovative player and a good friend, Buck had also been an inspiration to guitar players in his hometown. &ldquo;He was someone who loved music,&rdquo; Drew recalls. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d grab his guitar, get in his car and jump onstage with bands, long as they were playing original music. He proved to all the guitar players in town&mdash;Yes, you can do this! And Jeff was one of those guys who learned at the foot of the Buddah.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Erickson had already toured with the band as Buck&rsquo;s guitar tech, so he knew all the secret tunings and had an intuitive feel for the material. Still, Buck&rsquo;s death created a period of uncertainty as 10,000 Maniacs went to part-time status for a while.<\/p>\n<p>The band was fully rededicated with 2011&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Music From the Motion Picture<\/em>, its first studio album in 14 years. It was their first release that was fully crowd-funded and it was proof that the magic still worked.<\/p>\n<p>A number of fan-friendly projects followed, including 2015&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Twice Told Tales<\/em>, a full album of their arrangements of English traditional material. The album originally grew out of an onstage interlude where Ramsey would perform a traditional fiddle tune (fortuitously called &ldquo;Lady Mary Ramsey&rdquo;) between songs; Lombardo then stepped in and suggested a few of his own favorite songs. Their second fully crowd-funded effort, it also reconnected the band with its audience. &ldquo;Not all of us are social-media savvy, but our former manager walked us through the process and it really worked for us,&rdquo; says Gustafson.<\/p>\n<p>The band also released two overdue live albums with Ramsey singing: 2016&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Playing Favorites<\/em>&nbsp;and 2017&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Live at the Belly Up<\/em>&mdash;the first revisiting the greatest hits, the second featuring deeper cuts from the entire catalogue.<\/p>\n<p>Recent years have only brought the band members closer together, once again with a strong six-piece lineup. Current plans call for another studio album in the near future. &ldquo;Nobody is demanding that we write hits, so in some ways it&rsquo;s back to the beginning,&rdquo; Gustafson says. &ldquo;We have the luxury of having gone through another 35 years and gone through our sad and happy times together.&rdquo; Adds Drew, &ldquo;Musical ideas have never been a problem for us. We know what a gift it is to be able to do this. And we know from doing shows with the Grateful Dead that it&rsquo;s really about going onstage every night and playing as well as you can.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is always a magic that happens when people hear this music,&rdquo; Ramsey says. &ldquo;People want to be put under a spell, and we can help them escape the reality of every day. And,&rdquo; she laughs, &ldquo;We can give them an escape that&rsquo;s drug and calorie free.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_10000Maniacs_4_42_19_PM_3_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 27 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/10KManiacs"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0MBIKH9DjtBkv8O3nS6szj"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/10000Maniacs"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/maniacs.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/10KMTV"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/17\/2019 11:38:01 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"foghat":{"id":"4951","name":"Foghat","friendly_url":"foghat","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>Foghat&rsquo;s live performances show why the band is still around today and why they will be able to keep on rockin&rsquo; as long as they want. This band truly is timeless. Constant touring is part of their DNA and the band just loves to play. Their live show is as intense as ever with the incredible energy and musicianship that one would expect and hope for from a seasoned band with such a long musical history and they are bringing their fans along for the ride. Not content to rest on their laurels, the band released a great new studio album in June 2016 titled &ldquo;Under the Influence&rdquo;, and another 'live' album in June of 2017 called 'Live at the Belly Up'. Both were given great reviews by press audience alike. To keep the ball rolling, they are planning to release a live DVD in 2018!<\/p>\n<p>Foghat fans are everywhere and these days their audience consists of all ages. From the young kids who play Guitar Hero III and know all of the lyrics to &lsquo;Slow Ride&rsquo;, to the Dazed &amp; Confused generation of 30-40 somethings and the &lsquo;boomers&rsquo; who bought Foghat&rsquo;s first vinyl or 8 track! Looking out at the audience and seeing all of the generations rockin&rsquo; to Foghat is very gratifying to the band. According to lead singer Charlie Huhn, &ldquo;the band just wants to make sure that after every show, they are all convinced that they just got rocked, from the second we start the first song to the end of the show&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Formed in 1971 when Lonesome Dave Peverett and Roger Earl left the British blues-rock band, Savoy Brown, Foghat has earned eight Gold records, one Platinum record and one Double-Platinum record. And they continue to release new music every few years. They have never stopped touring and recording although there have been several ups and downs and changes over the years. They sadly lost Lonesome Dave Peverett in 2000 and Rod Price in 2005, but Roger Earl kept banging &amp; kicking to keep Foghat&rsquo;s musical legacy going.<\/p>\n<p>According to a recent review &ldquo;The &rsquo;70s called&hellip;but there is no way in hell we are giving Foghat back to them. The iconic band from the past is rocking just as hard as they did decades ago, if not more! Foghat&rsquo;s thunderous blend of blues, boogie and butt-kickin&rsquo; rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll are shaking walls and fans everywhere. There is so much talent in this band it is ridiculous. Lead vocalist\/rhythm guitarist Charlie Huhn played with Ted Nugent, Gary Moore &amp; Humble Pie, and lead\/slide guitarist Bryan Bassett played with Wild Cherry and Molly Hatchet.\" Bass player Craig Macgregor who had been with the band since the &rsquo;70s, unfortunately became ill in 2015 and was unable to play. Craig recommended the very talented &amp; personable Rodney O'Quinn as a 'fill-in' who came to Foghat via the Pat Travers band where he proved he knew how to lay down a solid groove. O'Quinn viewed MacGregor as a mentor and is a great permanent addition to the band. And on drums is the man we have to thank for keeping Foghat going&hellip;founding member Roger Earl, who's positive attitude and solid drumming style and pure joy of playing has been an inspiration to all.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>If Foghat had only given us &lsquo;Slow Ride&rsquo;, the band&rsquo;s place in rock history would be secure. But the band is so much more than that. As stated by Roger Earl, &ldquo;we are still a &lsquo;work in progress&rsquo;, writing and recording, and plan to be until the day we depart this earth&rdquo;!<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Foghat_3_05_46_PM_3_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 27 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Foghat"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/foghat_official\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/foghat"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FOGHAT"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/foghat.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/FOGHATMUSIC"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/08\/2019 03:15:40 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"andrew-wk":{"id":"4970","name":"Andrew W.K.","friendly_url":"andrew-wk","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p>It all began with a feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Of being alone and wanting to belong.<\/p>\n<p>Of wanting to share that feeling of belonging.<\/p>\n<p>And experience the euphoria of bonding with others.<\/p>\n<p>The feeling became a dream.<\/p>\n<p>To make the most exciting music imaginable.<\/p>\n<p>Music that embraced and celebrated life in all its facets, electrifying and uniting everyone who heard it.<\/p>\n<p>The dream attained reality in major chords pounded out on piano, an unrelenting four-to-the-floor beat, a set of dirty whites, a bloody nose.<\/p>\n<p>And found its voice with these words:<\/p>\n<p>\"When it's time to party, we will party hard.\"<\/p>\n<p>It's safe to say, nobody has partied harder, longer or more fervently than the undisputed King of Partying himself, Andrew W.K.. A one-man music machine possessed of a single-minded, monomaniacal focus to spread a singular message:<\/p>\n<p>That to party is to exist.<\/p>\n<p>And to exist is to party.<\/p>\n<p>This mission he embarked upon in 2001, with the release of his debut single and signature tune \"Party Hard,\" and has never swerved from since. Released the same year, his debut album I Get Wet, an instant, ageless classic, was a full-throated declaration of that hedonistic intent. Twelve songs, no ballads, delivered at breakneck speed and with maximum intensity from beginning to end. All the bluntness, passion and classicism of rock 'n' roll, boiled down and purified to its base elements.<\/p>\n<p>Power. Movement. Melody. Emotion. Noise.<\/p>\n<p>A sound simultaneously life-affirming, enervating and overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>A sound that obliterates ego and bludgeons self.<\/p>\n<p>As an artist, he seemed to have emerged out of nowhere, fully-formed right out of the box, with an image, a style, and a sense of purpose that set him far apart from his peers. If that seemed to good to be true, then maybe it was. Andrew W.K., the critics opined, was either the savior of music or its biggest fraud. Either deadly serious or an elaborate prank. None of which bothered the fans who took up the mantle of the Andrew W.K. ethos, to live every moment as if it was simultaneously their first and their last. Live shows, backed by a six-piece band of hard-driving musicians, became a collective celebration of unbridled joy that often turned entire dance floors into a giant, whirling circle pit of jostling bodies, with sweat and hair flying, and ended in a mass stage invasion that tore down the boundary between artist and audience.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later came The Wolf, an album that doubled as a manual for self-realization, blending the personal with the philosophical, drawing on the past to forge a path towards the future, then folding back on itself like a M&ouml;bius strip, invoking an existence with no beginning, no end, seamless. From this point on, his fans became his friends and allies in a cause undertaken purely for its own sake; an idea explored further in a 2004 MTV series, Your Friend, Andrew W.K., where he offered himself up as cheerleader and life coach, helping others to realize themselves and their dreams.<\/p>\n<p>A third album in 2006, Close Calls With Brick Walls, as ambitious in scope and sound as it was oblique in theme and tone, suggested an artist who seemed to have freed himself from all the restrictions placed upon him, by himself and by others, who had peered into a looking glass and seen... his mirror image, staring back. Everything that he was and everything that he wasn't, merged into one. A series of reflections arching backwards into infinity. Multiple images of a face with the same forced smile. As if Andrew W.K., the performer, had been replaced by a different person entirely.<\/p>\n<p>The rumors that had persisted since the very beginning of his career, began to multiply and take hold, begging the question: not who is Andrew W.K., but what is Andrew W.K.? A person, a persona, a wig. An entity, a corporation or a symbol. An enigma behind a set of initials.<\/p>\n<p>That question would remain unanswered as, over the next decade, Andrew W.K. adopted a dizzying array of roles that took him into virgin territory for a rock 'n' roll musician, establishing a unique place for himself in popular culture, as a ubiquitous celebrity presence, while at the same time calling into question the very nature of that celebrity. Advice columnist, university lecturer, and children's game show host. Nightclub impresario, talk radio personality and talk show guest. Motivational speaker and cultural ambassador. Performance artist and magician's assistant. Party philosopher and weatherman. He was all these things and more.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as he readies the release of a brand new album of rock music, his first in over a decade, and prepares to embark on his first full-band tour in five years, Andrew W.K. has come full circle to celebrate a party still raging strong.<\/p>\n<p>A party that is now and forevermore.<\/p>\n<p>Because the party never dies.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AndrewW.K._2_21_42_PM_2_28_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/andrewwk"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/andrewwk\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4YJR4xviDKHoelt9WKHlBa"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AndrewWK"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.andrewwk.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AndrewWK\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/04\/2019 02:27:18 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"cory-wong-of-vulfpeck":{"id":"5121","name":"Cory Wong (of Vulfpeck)","friendly_url":"cory-wong-of-vulfpeck","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p><strong>Cory Wong <\/strong>of Vulfpeck&nbsp;might just be your new favorite guitar player.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Minneapolis-based musician has put in his time as a versatile composer, arranger, producer, and collaborator.

Their crazy, fun-loving attitude compliments Common Kings&rsquo; live sound, producing phenomenal pop hits with rock, reggae, and R&amp;B influences. These influences originate from each band members love for various genres, and widespread knowledge of music.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of Common Kings were born in the South Pacific, and raised in Orange County, California. Growing up with households full of colorful personality and vibrant passions for music, Common Kings&rsquo; members naturally grew up forming individual musical paths. This musical journey involved mimicking and listening to artists such as Van Morrison, Stevie Wonder, George Benson, Jim Croce, Michael Jackson, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Gypsy Kings, Earth Wind and Fire, Bob Marley and more. The culmination of these musicians explains exactly who the Common Kings are.<\/p>\n<p>Where everything comes to a point is through lead singer Sasualei &ldquo;Junyer King&rdquo; Maliga. Junyer King is perhaps one of the most impressive vocalists amongst today&rsquo;s leading artists. Born with this untrained raw-talent, Junyer King&rsquo;s singing ability seems boundless, as he amazes listeners with a wide range of belting notes and soulful passion. His humble demeanor off-stage needs no introduction as to when the band is rocking out on-stage creating a young, wild, and free atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>With the success of their album &lsquo;Lost In Paradise,&rsquo; added to their recent achievement of reaching 500,000 single downloads, along with their remarkable touring accomplishments (providing direct support for major acts such as opening two sold out shows for Bruno Mars at Aloha Stadium in November, Justin Timberlake&rsquo;s 20\/20 World Experience Tour, Meghan Trainor&rsquo;s Untouchable Tour and Matisyahu&rsquo;s 2017 Fall Tour), Common Kings keeps the momentum alive after releasing their critically acclaimed latest EP &lsquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/commonkingsofficial\/sets\/one-day-42\">One Day<\/a>,&rsquo; on August 10th, 2018.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into&nbsp;REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.<br \/><br \/>Jim&rsquo;s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin&rsquo; Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols&nbsp;(a young Lydon was connected to Jim&rsquo;s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.<br \/><br \/>Heath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease,&nbsp;<em>Whole New Life,&nbsp;<\/em>which Heath calls &ldquo;the most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>Call it a new twist on an old sound,&nbsp;<em>Whole New Life<\/em>&nbsp;was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band&rsquo;s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna &lsquo;RJ&rsquo; Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend&rsquo;s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. &ldquo;I love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>Recording the album, Heath recalled that &ldquo;Back in the 1950&rsquo;s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I&rsquo;m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice.&nbsp;<em>Whole New Life<\/em>&nbsp;brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;This tour started around 1986,&rdquo; Heath chuckles dryly.&nbsp;REVEREND HORTON HEAT&nbsp;still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton&rsquo;s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton&rsquo;s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term &lsquo;Special Guests&rsquo; on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, &ldquo;The idea of playing in Jerry&rsquo;s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we&rsquo;ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we&rsquo;ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where&nbsp;REVEREND HORTON HEAT&nbsp;is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do &lsquo;Ace Of Spades.&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.&rsquo; He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said &lsquo;Never give them what they want, give them what they need!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>With over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you,&nbsp;REVEREND HORTON HEAT&nbsp;is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.<br \/><br \/><em>Whole New Life<\/em>&nbsp;was delivered November 30, 2018.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ReverendHortonHeat_3_38_38_PM_3_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 30 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 30","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/reverendhortonheat"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/revhortonheatofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4byZW0sEv5RUoyQBfv7CPw"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/revhortonheat"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.reverendhortonheat.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/OfficialRHH"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/08\/2019 03:38:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-spinners":{"id":"4986","name":"The Spinners","friendly_url":"the-spinners","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>Most often thought of as a Mowtown recording act, the classic group sound of legendary R&amp;B recording artists, <strong><em>The Spinners<\/em><\/strong> has never lost its universal appeal.

With Willy Jordan and Bob Welsh, Bishop whomps out tough, muscular and rollicking boogie-infused blues.&rdquo; &ndash;No Depression<\/p>\n<p>Ever since Rock &amp; Roll and Blues Hall Of Famer Elvin Bishop first hit the scene with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band back in 1965, he&rsquo;s blazed his own musical trail. Whether he was playing raw, eye-popping blues, or penning the evergreen radio hit <em>Fooled Around And Fell In Love<\/em>, or touring the world for decades delivering his original, good-time countrified blues, Bishop has always inspired his fans with his rowdy guitar playing and witty, slice-of-life songs. <em>Rolling Stone<\/em> calls Bishop &ldquo;a legendary guitarist&rdquo; whose playing is &ldquo;impeccable and spirited...a distinguished American player.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Late in 2015, Elvin Bishop formed The Big Fun Trio, with Bishop on guitar and vocals, and his friends Bob Welsh on piano and guitar and Willy Jordan on caj&oacute;n (a hand-played Peruvian drumbox) and vocals. After playing just a handful of live dates, the group&rsquo;s instantly crowd-pleasing music and undeniable chemistry took the blues world by storm. With the release of their self-titled CD in 2017, media and fan response was immediate and overwhelming. <em>DownBea<\/em>t celebrated Bishop&rsquo;s &ldquo;verbal hijinks, outstanding guitar work and country boy friendliness.&rdquo; <em>OffBeat <\/em>said The Big Fun Trio was &ldquo;intricate, funky and uplifting,&rdquo; declaring them, &ldquo;consistently great.&rdquo; With its top-shelf musicianship and front-porch vibe, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Fun Trio quickly discovered the more they played live, the more fun they had making music together. So a follow-up recording was an easy decision. The new album, <em>Something Smells Funky &lsquo;Round Here<\/em>, finds the group fearlessly laying it all on the line. According to Elvin, &ldquo;With a trio there&rsquo;s no place to hide&shy;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to&nbsp;be pourin&rsquo; everything you got right out front. You need to be totally into it all the time. It&rsquo;s really cool to see how people react to the goin&rsquo;-for-it feel of the music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album mixes rousing, new originals, reinventions of three Bishop classics and some unexpected, soul-shaking covers. <em>Something Smells Funky &lsquo;Round Here<\/em> was produced by Bishop and Steve Savage and recorded at Bishop&rsquo;s Hog Heaven Studio in Lagunitas, California. Bishop wrote or co-wrote five songs (including two by the entire trio). The potent title track&mdash;a tongue-in-cheek State Of The Union address as only Elvin can deliver&mdash; kicks the album off with Bishop aiming his lyrical truths at those in power. The humorous but piercingly direct lyrics take aim at the current political scene while Bishop&rsquo;s deep blues guitar playing drives the point home.<\/p>\n<p><em>Lookin&rsquo; Good<\/em> finds Bishop autobiographically gazing in the rearview mirror with sharp, wry lyrics accompanied by Welsh&rsquo;s perfect blues piano. Willy Jordan sings lead on four songs, including blistering reinventions of Jackie Wilson&rsquo;s <em>Higher And Higher<\/em> and Ann Peebles&rsquo; <em>I Can&rsquo;t Stand The Rain<\/em>. Bob Welsh, whose guitar or piano playing highlight every song, pounds the ivories on his own <em>Bob&rsquo;s Boogie<\/em>. &ldquo;This album fell together easily,&rdquo; says Bishop. &ldquo;Everything I visualized about the songs&mdash;from Bob&rsquo;s playing to Willy&rsquo;s singing, came true. Bob and Willy are great musicians.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>According to San Francisco Bay native Jordan, who has decades of experience playing drums with artists including John Lee Hooker, Joe Louis Walker and Angela Strehli, playing in the Big Fun Trio is &ldquo;crazy different. It&rsquo;s rootsy but also new. We all stayed simple to stay strong.&rdquo; Welsh, originally from Covington, Louisiana, has performed and toured with Bishop, Rusty Zinn, Charlie Musselwhite, Billy Boy Arnold, James Cotton and others. Welsh says he too loves playing in the Trio. &ldquo;Playing this music is fun and fresh and new to us. It keeps us on our toes. We&rsquo;re always surprising each other. We have to be fearless.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Born in Glendale, CA on October 21, 1942, Bishop grew up on a farm in Iowa before relocating to Oklahoma when he was ten. He first got hooked on the blues listening to late night R&amp;B radio as a teenager, and began collecting, listening to and absorbing blues music. Once Bishop realized that many of his favorite records were recorded in Chicago, he used his 1959 National Merit Scholarship as a way to get closer to his blues heroes by enrolling in the University of Chicago, whose campus was located near dozens of the South Side clubs.<\/p>\n<p>After Elvin crossed paths with harmonica player and fellow University of Chicago student Paul Butterfield, the two began sitting in together at South Side clubs, often jamming with Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. They first formed The Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963, adding Jerome Arnold on bass, Sam Lay on drums and later Mark Naftalin on keyboards. Prior to cutting their debut LP in 1965, Michael Bloomfield joined the group as second lead guitarist, creating a groundbreaking, all-star band. The self-titled <em>The Paul Butterfield Blues Band<\/em> introduced electric Chicago blues to the rock audience for the first time. With the release of <em>East\/West<\/em> in 1966, the band&rsquo;s popularity hit an all-time high. Their straight Chicago blues sounds drifted further into progressive and experimental rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll and&mdash;with two world-class lead guitarists on board&mdash;the band helped pave the way for groups featuring multiple virtuoso guitarists, like The Allman Brothers Band and Derek and the Dominos. The band, including Bishop, was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Towards the end of the 1960s, after recording three albums with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin decided to move on, heading for the San Francisco area. He became a regular at the famed Fillmore Auditorium jam sessions, playing alongside Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, B.B. King and many others before embarking on a solo career. He recorded first for Fillmore Records, then Epic and then for Capricorn, where his career took off. He charted with <em>Travelin&rsquo; Shoes<\/em> before scoring big in 1975 with <em>Fooled Around And Fell In Love<\/em> (the song reached number three on the pop charts and was prominently featured in the blockbuster film, <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy<\/em>). <\/p>\n<p>After a seven-year recording hiatus, Elvin returned to his blues roots in 1988, signing with Alligator and releasing five albums between 1988 and 2000. After a few releases on other labels, Bishop returned to Alligator with 2014&rsquo;s <em>Can&rsquo;t Even Do Wrong Right<\/em>, and once again turned the music-loving world on its head. Reviews poured in from NPR&rsquo;s <em>Fresh Air<\/em>, <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>, <em>Living Blues, No Depression<\/em> and many others. He appeared on TBS-Television&rsquo;s <em>CONAN<\/em> and performed numerous times on <em>A Prairie Home Companion<\/em>, most recently with The Big Fun Trio.<\/p>\n<p>With <em>Something Smells Funky &lsquo;Round Here<\/em>, Elvin Bishop&rsquo;s Big Fun Trio are clearly having a very good time. Having spent almost three years performing, these three tremendously talented musicians continue to inspire each other to new heights. As Elvin Bishop&rsquo;s Big Fun Trio take their music back on the road, fans will once again have a chance to experience the big fun first hand.

It&rsquo;s actually pretty good!&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Butler was riding high on that particular sense of freedom that comes when you&rsquo;ve decided your life plan is to just say yes to pretty much everything. So you don&rsquo;t really care that you&rsquo;re broke and subsisting on stolen jack-o-lanterns, because you&rsquo;re not in your suburban high school anymore, hiding your disdain for the cheerleaders. You&rsquo;re in a weird and cool new town, hanging out with musicians and designers and artists. You&rsquo;re free to mess around. Explore. And just when you&rsquo;re starting to get a little over living &ldquo;four people deep,&rdquo; as Butler puts it, in your tiny apartment, another friend says, hey, come out to Wisconsin for a while. So you do. (Because: say yes!) And a while later, when, boozy in a bar one night, you hear some beats you think you&rsquo;d like to write lyrics to, even though you&rsquo;ve never so much as held a microphone in your life, you go for it. (Say. Yes.) And the next thing you know, you&rsquo;re fronting a dynamic, dirty, synth-pop carnival of a band, hearing your single on the radio, and touring the country.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s Margaret Butler&rsquo;s story. And that&rsquo;s the story of her band, a group as inspired by the shimmery decadence of Queen as they are by the primal yowl of Black Sabbath as they are by the madcap joy of Yeah Yeah Yeahs. GGOOLLDD is one of the most resolutely celebratory rock acts to emerge in years.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to understand how someone like Butler, a woman with seemingly limitless natural charisma and an obsession with dressing up in outrageous costumes (Halloween is her favorite holiday) would eventually find her way onstage, but the singer insists that rock stardom was never part of her plan. &ldquo;I never even considered being a musician, I always wanted to be a clothing designer, or a chef,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always created with my hands.&rdquo; Butler&rsquo;s father is jeweler, and technically that&rsquo;s what she was studying to be as well. But she learned all her really important college-years lessons bartending at the Spanish Moon, a legendary venue in Baton Rouge. &ldquo;It was the only cool place to go and watch music in the city,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I got to see every amazing band as they were coming up, from TV On the Radio to Of Montreal to Dirty Projectors.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even though Butler&rsquo;s always loved music (she&rsquo;s an obsessive of the first order) aside from the one time she &ldquo;got really stoned and watched a John Bonham documentary then went right out and bought a pair of blue 1970s Ludwigs,&rdquo; she never tried to become a serious musician. &ldquo;I have great internal rhythm, I&rsquo;m just too A.D.D. to sit down and actually play,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I own eight different instruments and I&rsquo;ve gotten as far as like a week on each of them.&rdquo; But her culture, her people, her tribe has always been connected to music. The people she met in and around the Spanish Moon were the ones she moved to Portland with, and it was through that world that she wound up, one random early fall afternoon in 2013, recording vocals, in the foyer of her house in Milwaukee, to what would become GGOOLLDD&rsquo;s breakthrough debut single. &ldquo;It was the first song we ever wrote and it was called &lsquo;Gold,&rsquo;&rdquo; she recalls of the soulfully grimy track, on which bassist Nick Ziemann, guitarist Thomas Gilbert also played. (They added drummer Mark Stewart and synth player Nick Schubert soon after). &ldquo;We were like, &lsquo;Oh we need a name for the band - I guess it should be the same thing as the song title.&rdquo; A quick Google search revealed &ldquo;eight other bands named Gold,&rdquo; but they were all basically unsearchable because the word is so widely used, &ldquo;so we just decided to double letter it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thinking nothing of it, they threw the song up on Bandcamp, planning to go back to their day jobs, but that&rsquo;s when the serendipity hurricane began. &ldquo;Somehow college radio picks it up,&rdquo; Butler recalls. &ldquo;And it starts getting really good responses. And then it&rsquo;s on their list of top-ten-plays list, which is just insane.&rdquo; So they figured, why not keep this going for a while? &ldquo;We were like, this is fun! Let&rsquo;s write like three more songs, do a cover, and throw a party for Halloween where we can all wear gold costumes!&rdquo; The Halloween party is now the stuff of GGOOLLDD legend. &ldquo;I was Santigold, but instead of dressing up like the singer, I made an all gold Santa costume,&rdquo; Butler recalls, laughing. &ldquo;We played a terrible show to eight-some people crammed into our attic and it was one of the funnest nights ever! After that, people just kept asking us to play.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Butler, who had by this time opened a vintage clothing business with her friends, initially thought of the band mostly as a good excuse to express her most playful sartorial impulses. &ldquo;We had our next show two weeks later so I made this weird tassled vinyl gold overlay on top of a crushed velvet gold romper,&rdquo; she remembers, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before they all realized this band had become more than an excuse to dress up. After that second show, CMJ picked up &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; from the local Milwaukee radio station, 91.7, and from there, other college radio stations around the country began playing the track as well. The same un-mixed, un-mastered version they had made on Garage Band. &ldquo;After about a year I was like, people like this a lot better and they want to pay me a lot more than they do for vintage clothing, so I think I&rsquo;m just going to do this instead,&rdquo; Butler recalls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been three years and we have ten songs that are out right now, and we&rsquo;re working on the next album.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>GGOOLLDD isn&rsquo;t like other bands. They formed on whim, decided to play their first show mostly as an excuse to host a killer party, and they eschew the traditional gotta-get-a-record-deal game in favor of playing a lot of shows and releasing their own material. That sense of whimsy blended with resolute autonomy is all part of the signature GGOOLLDD aesthetic. And it feeds into their sound, especially lately. &nbsp;&ldquo;Undercovers,&rdquo; their new single, is a soaring banger that conjures wind-in-your-hair glittery romanticism. Co-produced and mixed by Ben H. Allen (MIA, Animal Collective) it reflects that core tension in GGOOLLDD between winging it and great artistry. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I&rsquo;m great at writing a hook,&rdquo; Butler says, and is quick to point out that her bandmates are &ldquo;amazing,&rdquo; musicians. &ldquo;But if you ask me what I do, I&rsquo;m going to tell you that I&rsquo;m a performer before I tell you that I&rsquo;m a musician.&rdquo; She pauses and cracks up. &ldquo;Unless you don&rsquo;t know me at all,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to say I&rsquo;m a musician, because if I say I&rsquo;m a performer, you&rsquo;re going to automatically think that I&rsquo;m a stripper, which is totally ok too but not my current profession.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GGOOLLDD_11_05_37_AM_3_29_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ggoollddband"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ggoolldd\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0AeOqmIHozTkj0uWXOlLr7"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GGOOLLDDband"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.ggoollddband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YY5SeK2BJB8"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/29\/2019 11:06:15 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"royal-tusk":{"id":"5161","name":"Royal Tusk","friendly_url":"royal-tusk","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p>Blue-collar troubadours from the Great White North, ROYAL TUSK are steadfast champions of the majesty of kickass riffs, meaty hooks, a thick bottom end, and loud guitars. The four-piece band born in Edmonton, Alberta mount a high-octane assault on the lazy security-blanket self-aware irony of hipsters and the disingenuous commercial pandering of rock poseurs alike.<\/p>\n<p>Trailblazers like Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Pearl Jam defined success on their own terms, putting artistry and authenticity first. Royal Tusk follows in that fine tradition, reveling in unbridled creativity that is provocative, nuanced, and captivating. The laidback charisma of stoner groove, the polished melodicism of classic and progressive rock, and the energy of punk all collide within Royal Tusk, earning them a steadily building buzz as big as their riffs.<\/p>\n<p>This is music with meaning, sometimes even a message, that&rsquo;s always built around a powerful vibe and uncompromising passion. Royal Tusk is a deeply soulful celebration, brimming with working class optimism and tempered by renegade realism. On their sophomore-slump-smashing <em>TUSK II<\/em>, the group summons the effortless energy of an era of rock music when bands weren&rsquo;t content to merely reverse-engineer hit-making formulas to move units.<\/p>\n<p>The seeds of Royal Tusk were planted when eight-year-old Daniel Carriere knocked on his neighbor&rsquo;s door. They&rsquo;d never met, but Carriere knew that Sandy MacKinnon and his siblings owned some instruments and figured maybe they could start a band. This began a creative partnership that eventually resulted in Royal Tusk, a band with more in common with Deep Purple and Aerosmith than anything on the radio. They released the <em>Mountain <\/em>EP in 2014; their debut full-length, <em>DealBreaker<\/em>, arrived two years later.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of &lsquo;rock&rsquo; today sounds like people forgot that it&rsquo;s supposed to be driven by loud guitars,&rdquo; says MacKinnon. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something we have to bring back.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Carriere, MacKinnon, guitarist Quinn Cyrankiewicz, and drummer Calen Stuckel take that faithful and earnest approach all over <em>TUSK II<\/em>, an album equally fueled by throwback minimalism and forward-thinking power.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a healthy dose of observational commentary about the massively screwed up state of the world. &ldquo;Our earlier stuff was a bit more gentle,&rdquo; Carriere explains. &ldquo;It was about love. This record is angry, fed up, perplexed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want people to think of us the way we think about our favorite bands,&rdquo; adds MacKinnon. &ldquo;When people listen to Royal Tusk, I hope it connects to experiences that matter in people&rsquo;s lives. That&rsquo;s the reason why we do this.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_RoyalTusk_7_33_50_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 3 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 3","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royaltusk\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/royaltuskmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/122qG4lB9vG6XCjrwJPnRJ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/royaltusk"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.royaltusk.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCxyCCjUwQIWNlcJ7CRpCqPw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/17\/2019 05:01:23 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"evidence":{"id":"5215","name":"Evidence","friendly_url":"evidence","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Evidence has announced the release of Weather Or Not, his third full-length solo album. Set for a January 26, 2018 release on Rhymesayers Entertainment, the project features the viral hit &ldquo;Throw It All Away,&rdquo; for which the Stephen Vanasco-directed video has logged more than 1.6 million views. Featuring collaborations with Slug (Atmosphere), Rakaa (Dilated Peoples), Alchemist, and more, as well as production from Evidence, Alchemist, Nottz and DJ Premier, among others, Weather Or Not is a familiar turn of phrase for his die-hard fans.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;On the Dilated Peoples song &lsquo;Guaranteed&rsquo;, I had a line that said, &lsquo;Some think I&rsquo;m clever, others think I&rsquo;m the one who makes too many references to weather&hellip; or not,&rsquo;&rdquo; Evidence explains. &ldquo;Every time I would perform that song live, the crowd would always say the &lsquo;or not.&rsquo; So I knew I was on to something and it would eventually be an album title.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Along with announcing the album, Evidence also debuts the official video for the Nottz-produced single, &ldquo;Jim Dean&rdquo;, featuring cuts by DJ Babu. The video, directed by Jason Goldwatch, manages to narrate the lyrics by fusing moving and still images together through the creative idea of bringing SSUR shirts to life.<\/p>\n<p>As fans would expect, Weather or Not embodies the heart of the hip-hop culture; clever wordplay laid over heavy boom-bap production, but Evidence also exhibits his gift for weaving moments of personal and introspective reflection into his writing. On &ldquo;Love is A Funny Thing&rdquo;, he muses on the things we love and, along with guests Rapsody and Styles P, the three dissect the way we misuse that word&rsquo;s multiple meanings and abuse its power. Evidence also provides an intimate look into his personal life on &ldquo;By My Side Too,&rdquo; which documents how his son saved his mother&rsquo;s life by indirectly discovering her cancer.<\/p>\n<p>As a solo artist and one-third of Dilated Peoples, Evidence has established himself as one of hip-hop&rsquo;s most accomplished rappers and producers, working with Domo Genesis, Linkin Park, Beastie Boys, Defari, Madchild and Krondon, among others. His production work earned a Grammy Award for co-production on Kanye's \"College Dropout\" and two JUNO Awards for his work with Canadian hip-hop group Swollen Members.<\/p>\n<p>Through it all, he&rsquo;s remained true to his hard-core hip-hop sonic and lyrical sensibility, which continues on Weather Or Not. &ldquo;After we made our most recent Dilated Peoples album (Directors of Photography in 2014), I was like, &lsquo;Now what?&rsquo; Evidence states. &ldquo;Right away I started doing my weather thing again. I made this new album with loyalists in mind. There&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s unintentional.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Evidence has also emerged as a world-renowned photographer with more than 335,000 Instagram followers. His work has been featured by numerous streetwear brands, including Diamond Supply and V\/SUAL, as well as Dos Equis, and is currently on display in the Watts, California restaurant, LocoL, owned by celebrity chef, Roy Choi.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Evidence_1_52_06_PM_4_7_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 7:45 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/misterevidence\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/evidence\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6VfeYClQyVUCPJdXb9jl3O"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/evidence"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/rhymesayers.com\/artists\/evidence"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/05\/2019 04:18:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dem-atlas":{"id":"5147","name":"deM atlaS","friendly_url":"dem-atlas","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>When Joshua Turner was a kid growing up in a dysfunctional home in Minneapolis there were two things that he&rsquo;d turn to for comfort when his parents fought: the Fugees records he&rsquo;d listen to on a loop to drown out their conflict and the atlas he&rsquo;d pore over to pretend he was anywhere else. Today Turner&rsquo;s all grown up, but his sources of childhood refuge continue to play an integral role in his life. In his spare time he draws maps for fun, and, under the name deM atlaS, he&rsquo;s composing his emotionally complex hip-hop records aimed at listeners out in the world who are in need of some sonic solace of their own.<\/p>\n<p>His new album Bad Actress is only the latest in a string of releases&ndash;including the 9-song EP DWNR that, according to Pitchfork, &ldquo;splits the difference on 'depressed' and 'party mode.&rsquo;&rdquo; In some ways the new work feels like a debut, not just because it&rsquo;s his first proper LP, but because it represents the culmination of a twisting creative path that Turner&rsquo;s patiently been following since his teens. He was a poet, a painter, and the frontman for a rock band before he found his space in Minneapolis&rsquo;s prolific rap scene. Once there, a philosophy of saying yes to any opportunity that passed his way quickly led him from playing shows for nugs of weed to a showcase in front of Rhymesayers CEO Siddiq, and a single recording session with Atmosphere beatmaker Ant that kept going until they&rsquo;d made almost an entire album together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The title Bad Actress comes from Turner&rsquo;s inability to hide his true feelings, and he&rsquo;s packed the album with unguarded emotions centered around a lifetime of unhealthy relationships, struggles with mental illness, and an indomitable drive to overcome them. Musically it draws from every stage of Turner&rsquo;s young career, from the high school rock singer to the scruffy DIY-er who self-recorded his Charle Brwn EP while figuring out the basics of Garageband to the confident, versatile vocalist he is today, equally at home crooning and screaming as he is rapping over beats by heavy hitters like Ant and MF DOOM.<\/p>\n<p>From the grime-caked beats to the confessional lyrics to the supercharged guitars laced throughout, Bad Actress is an album that&rsquo;s deeply rooted in Minneapolis&rsquo;s singular hip-hop scene, where boom-bap never went out of style and raw honesty still beats flashy materialism. Turner&rsquo;s soulful singing voice, and his ability to navigate from the acidic Sly Stone funk of &ldquo;Gratitude&rdquo; to the acoustic balladry of &ldquo;Music Man&rdquo; to the purple-tinged minimalist gospel of &ldquo;Runnin Back&rdquo; make it clear that he&rsquo;s one of the young talents who&rsquo;s going to author the next chapter in the city&rsquo;s storied musical history. After all, an atlas isn&rsquo;t only a collection of maps, but a man who&rsquo;s strong enough to carry the weight of the whole world on his shoulders.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_deMatlaS_1_36_17_PM_4_6_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dematlas"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/rhymesayers.com\/artists\/dematlas"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dematlas"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Dr3JRE"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dematlas\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2ttC18RelZhUEjhJhJXSbJ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/07\/2019 03:17:02 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"sa-roc":{"id":"5162","name":"Sa-Roc","friendly_url":"sa-roc","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Sa-Roc has carved out her own lane through a combination of airtight wordplay and intelligent concepts. Over the course of her illustrious career, she&rsquo;s released a series of independent releases, performed alongside the likes of Talib Kweli, Dead Prez and Atmosphere, and she&rsquo;s one of the few MC&rsquo;s to perform regularly as a feature artist with The Roots, all around the country. Sa-Roc landed an underground hit in 2014 with &ldquo;The Who?&rdquo; featuring David Banner before signing to Rhymesayers Entertainment.

Every song, painting, innovation, poem - is just the latest statement in a conversation that is as old as human civilization. And Silent Planet is intends to add to this dialogue. Weaving together topics that range from historical injustice to the existential despair of modern life, Silent Planet has a message that burns with a hardcore indignation, while coupled with progressive instrumentation.<\/p>\n<p>In the band&rsquo;s latest effort, When the End Began, frontman and lyricist, Garrett Russell, explores the obscure and mystical Nietzschean concept of &ldquo;Eternal Return&rdquo; as it relates to the human experience. Haunted by recurring dreams of war, famine, and dead planets - further exacerbated by health complications and surgery, Russell was drawn to explore the concept of apocalypse in this latest batch of stories. When the End Began delves into instances of global and personal crisis - watershed moments between and within humanity - and aims to draw connection between the two. According to Russell &ldquo;Apocalypse signals an ending, sure, but also the birth of a new epoch. The challenge of hope calls us to find direction in the midst of chaos - to find purpose not away from pain, but within it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since the their inception in 2009, Silent Planet has never looked for handouts. Initially the band slowly gained traction playing local venues throughout California, subsequently expanding to DIY touring throughout the States. The band first gained prominence due to their vast array of intellectual influences, anchored by Russell&rsquo;s masters degree in psychology and field experience as a mental health therapist. However, it is their remarkably intimate connection with their listeners (who they often refer to as &ldquo;Lovers&rdquo;, eschewing the term &ldquo;fans&rdquo;) that has become their trademark in the music scene. Perhaps no single event better speaks to their grassroots base than their surprise, underdog victory of &ldquo;Underground Band of the Year&rdquo; at the 2017 APMA awards.<\/p>\n<p>Emphasizing integrity, the band has gone to extreme measures to ensure creative control to keep their DIY ethos intact. With this third full-length release, the band looks to establish themselves not as a mainstay in the genre, but as sonic trend-setters. Primary song architect and guitarist, Mitchell Stark, pushes the band into increasingly aggressive territory in this new release, accented by the distinguishably refined and progressive drumming of Alexrene Camarena. Further, the album showcases a wide vocal array, thanks to the dynamic singing range of bassist, Thomas Freckleton, who vacillates between anthemic choruses and contemplative verses throughout the record. In a genre fraught with cliche, Silent Planet managed their most deliberate, cohesive effort to date.<\/p>\n<p>When The End Began is further complimented by the talents of producer Will Putney, who in his second effort has managed to capture the band&rsquo;s aggressive live sound mix while retaining their more exploratory ambient elements. Additionally, Silent Planet opens a new chapter on the global front, signing an international license deal with Australia-based label UNFD, while renewing their deal with Seattle-based Solid State Records, who has released the bands first two studio LP&rsquo;s since the original signing in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about what the future holds for Silent Planet, they are refreshingly simple: &ldquo;We want to connect and grow. These songs are our way of giving back to so many of those who have given to us. On tour we&rsquo;ve met people isolated by bigotry, marred by addiction, scarred by loss - these songs are for them and anyone else grappling with these situations. Hope doesn&rsquo;t have to be an abstract concept.

And the New York Times, NPR and Rolling Stone will all gladly corroborate. But steel yourselves, folk fans, because he&rsquo;s about to follow his restless muse straight out from under the weight of everyone&rsquo;s expectations into the kind of glammy, jingle-jangle power-pop- and- psych-tinged sounds he hasn&rsquo;t dabbled in since his younger days playing lead guitar for a late-period incarnation of The New York Dolls.<\/p>\n<p>Really, the roots of Tasjan&rsquo;s new record, <em>Karma for Cheap<\/em>, stretch even deeper, drinking up the sounds of a Southern California childhood spent listening to The Beatles while riding around with his mom at the wheel of their navy blue Volvo station wagon&mdash; back to the very first pre-teen year he picked up a six-string and started figuring out all the pretty little chords in those Lennon-McCartney tunes. Back to the pure, blissful unfiltered innocence of falling in love with music for the first time. But more on that later. First, let&rsquo;s ponder the brutish realities of the American Swamp.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Lee Tasjan says he aims to use his music for good, but he&rsquo;s no protest singer. And <em>Karma for Cheap <\/em>isn&rsquo;t some heavy-handed, didactic political record cramming a set of talking points down anyone&rsquo;s throat. It&rsquo;s a finely tuned rock &amp; roll seismograph measuring the dark and uncertain vibrations of the time in which it was created. A cracked mirror reflecting back the American zeitgeist in this foul year of Our Lord, Two Thousand and Eighteen.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a songwriter,&rdquo; Tasjan says, you&rsquo;re dealing in truths and untruths&mdash;that&rsquo;s part of your commerce as a citizen of the world. And anything coming along that&rsquo;s threatening to blur that line is a threat to your livelihood as a working American.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Take it from Tasjan and <em>Karma for Cheap, <\/em>being a songwriter in the post-truth world of Trump&rsquo;s America ain&rsquo;t easy. Tasjan valiantly wrestles with this new normal in songs like &ldquo;Set You Free&rdquo; (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a smokescreen scene and nobody knows what&rsquo;s real&rdquo;&mdash;<em>fake news!)&nbsp;<\/em>and &ldquo;The Truth Is So Hard to Believe.&rdquo; What will we do when we can no longer map the line between fact and fiction? When we exist in a world where the truth is unknowable and we&rsquo;re at the mercy of liars and charlatans? &ldquo;Hearts in chains and hands are off the wheel,&rdquo; Tasjan sings in hypnotic staccato, tapping the collective cultural anxiety of all the rattled millions drifting off each night to a new American dream, one in which we&rsquo;re all in a big red, white and blue camaro fishtailing down some winding tree-lined road in the bible-black dark, white-knuckle-clutching the oh-shit bar, accelerator glued to the floor and not a soul in the driver&rsquo;s seat.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The sound of this new record is a little more rough and ready, more raw than anything I&rsquo;ve done before,&rdquo; Tasjan says. &ldquo;Seems like a good time for it. We&rsquo;re living in a pretty raw feed right now, and a lot of these new songs reflect that. They deal with with being stuck in the deluge of horseshit every day. On social media, you see people suckered into getting all irate over some post that, in the end, turns out to be completely fake. We have to be aware of these mindsets, these traps and emotional pitfalls that send us spinning. Music for me is a comfort thing. And I&rsquo;m trying to sing about all this to remind myself not to get caught up in the game. There are a lot of people out there carrying the burden of this weird, twisted world we&rsquo;re living in at the moment on their shoulders. So I tried to write a record that offers some comfort, encouragement and hope to those people, as much as it&rsquo;s possible to be hopeful right now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Karma for Cheap <\/em>is Tasjan&rsquo;s third LP and second for his label New West Records, based in his current hometown of Nashville. The record was co-produced by ALT and his friends Jeff Trott (Stevie Nicks, Liz Phair, Meiko, Joshua Radin) and Gregory Lattimer (Albert Hammond Jr.) and features Aaron Lee&rsquo;s road band&mdash;guitarist Brian Wright, bassist Tommy Scifres and drummer Seth Earnest&mdash;with whom he&rsquo;s been touring heavily for the last two years.<\/p>\n<p>While the stylistic shift from Tasjan&rsquo;s palpably stoned &lsquo;70s-country-channeling 2015 debut, <em>In the Blazes<\/em>, to his more sophisticated, introspective and lushly produced 2016 follow-up, <em>Silver Tears, <\/em>was relatively incremental, <em>Karma<\/em>&rsquo;s rocked-up Brit-pop- influenced Beatles-Bowie-Badfinger vibes underscore a significant departure. The album boldly reminagines these vintage sounds, pushing the boundary of what can be considered Americana. With <em>Karma<\/em>, Tasjan establishes himself as an artist who not only evolves over time, but isn&rsquo;t afraid to risk reinventing himself completely from one record to the next.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a goal for me to be able to <em>not <\/em>listen to the part of my brain that cares what other people think, and just do something really pure and from the heart,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I needed this album to have a sense of adventure and mystery, to feel a little shaky and dangerous at times&mdash;something that wasn&rsquo;t the obvious choice in terms of what people already like about what I do. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that I&rsquo;m a searcher, which means I&rsquo;m going to be searching <em>forever<\/em>.&rdquo; Aaron Lee pauses and laughs at the notion, and what&rsquo;s in store for the rest of his life&mdash;<em>ticket bought, ride in progress<\/em>. &ldquo;Yep, this is never going to end,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;No oasis, no safe harbor to stop and say, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve gotten here, and now I&rsquo;m good.&rsquo; In some ways it&rsquo;s a harsh realization&mdash;living in that type of headspace can cause a lot of turmoil. But if you can find beauty in the mundane&hellip; well, there you go. I&rsquo;ve definitely been making more of an effort to enjoy the journey.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For all the album&rsquo;s wrestling with social and political discord and the stresses of modern life due to the grand experiment of social media and the unforgiving tractor beam of the world-<em>wired<\/em>-web, <em>Karma for Cheap <\/em>finds its silver lining in the innocence of a wide- eyed kid&rsquo;s maiden voyage into the electrifying thrall of rock &amp; roll. The heaviness of the lyrical content is tempered by the joy and wonder of an artist reconnecting with what made him fall in love with playing music in the first place. The sound of it, the way it made him feel when he was 11 years old and it was all still as new as a fresh coat of spray paint from the can of some smug delinquent. That was 1997&mdash;the year Tasjan moved from Ohio to California, and scored his first guitar and a stack of iconic CDs by The Beatles, Oasis and Tom Petty.<\/p>\n<p>A huge sonic touchstone for ALT&rsquo;s new record is <em>The Beatles Anthology<\/em>, one of his childhood favorites. In songs like &ldquo;If Not Now When,&rdquo; &ldquo;Song Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rest Is Yet to Come,&rdquo; you can hear echoes of George Harrison&rsquo;s vibrant guitar riffs and Jeff Lynne&rsquo;s lavish production on those lo-fi John Lennon demos the surviving Beatles dug up and polished off in the mid &lsquo;90s. &ldquo;&lsquo;Free As A Bird&rsquo; and &lsquo;Real Love&rsquo;&mdash;those were my jams when I first started playing guitar,&rdquo; Tasjan says. &ldquo;I was learning those and a lot of other Beatles songs. And then Oasis came out with &lsquo;Wonderwall&rsquo; and I was like, oh that&rsquo;s The Beatles for my generation, and I became obsessed with them, too.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most poignant moment on <em>Karma for Cheap <\/em>is the anthemic, hypnotic &ldquo;Heart Slows Down,&rdquo; a tune rife with musical and lyrical references to the Beatles and Tom Petty, anchored by an unforgettable chorus with a Traveling Wilburys vibe that finds the sweet spot between Tasjan&rsquo;s two earliest musical heroes. &ldquo;When I was a kid, my favorite CD to fall asleep to was Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers&rsquo; <em>Greatest Hits<\/em>, and the last song is a cover of that Thunderclap Newman song &lsquo;Something in the Air.&rsquo; From the time I was a little kid to when I was teenager, I used to listen to that song on headphones almost every night&mdash;I heard it in that space between wake and sleep so many times. And Tom&rsquo;s passing&mdash;he was a really big hero of mine, so it hit me pretty hard. We were in Seattle playing a show when I heard, and it was a heavy thing to process. But all of those elements are there in &lsquo;Heart Slows Down.&rsquo; The chorus, &lsquo;I will always be around,&rsquo; is a reminder that all the good you ever got out of listening to this music is still around you. You&rsquo;ll always have that.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AaronLeeTasjan_11_00_15_AM_3_29_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 27 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 27","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/therealaaronleetasjan"},{"type":"instagram","link":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/aaronleetasjan"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/aaronleetasjan"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aaronleetasjan1"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/aaronleetasjan.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4PztbfCny3X9gBjlpgvjYo"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:11:31 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-allman-betts-band":{"id":"4940","name":"The Allman Betts Band","friendly_url":"the-allman-betts-band","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>After a successful year touring as The Devon Allman Project with special guest Duane Betts, the sons of Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts are joining forces to form The Allman Betts Band.<\/p>\n<p>They will kick off 2019 with a new Allman Betts Band album and a Worldwide tour that will feature new music, songs from their solo projects and classic Allman Brothers and Gregg Allman tunes in honor of the 50th Anniversary of The Allman Brothers Band.

It seems the secret to their success is simple. Keyboardist Patrick Kelly confides, \"There is a universal groove in the music that we play,\" while bass guitarist Adam Castaneda adds, \"I don't think any of us are trying to impress anyone with our technical abilities, we just want to make them dance.\"<\/p>\n<p>Shanachie Entertainment will release The Suffers' highly anticipated label debut <strong><em>Everything Here <\/em><\/strong>on July 13, 2018<em>. <\/em>Guitarist Kevin Bernier says, \"<strong><em>Everything Here<\/em><\/strong>, as a whole, explores the many aspects of who we are as people through songs. We've had crushes on people, we've had our hearts broken, and we've moved through all the difficult times so that we can experience the joyful moments.\" The Suffers have got everything you need and there's no need to look further - a heaping dose of soul, a dash of reggae, a splash of jazz, a pinch of salsa, a hint of rock 'n' roll and a dollop of hip hop and funk - and that is just a few ingredients simmering inside their magical Gulf Coast soul. Percussionist Jose Luna says, \"The glue that holds us together is our experience. We have all played with so many bands and musicians through the years that we have learned how not to step on each others toes.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Everything Here, <\/em><\/strong>a riveting collection of 15 originals that gives props to Houston (there are even cameos from Houston rappers Paul Wall and Bun B), explores the many sides of love, celebrates the virtues of individuality, reminds us of the destruction of Harvey and resilience of the human spirit and declares love for their mothers. All of these themes coalesce into one soulful soundtrack. The band co-produced the album with John Allen Stephens and Zeke Listenbee co-produced on several tracks.<\/p>\n<p>Trombonist Michael Razo explains, \"One of our goals was to have the songs on the album flow or tie into each other. Like creating an album where you just press play and let it go without having to skip to the next song.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The Suffers are a contemporary version of the great R&amp;B\/funk bands of 70s and 80s...Rufus, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Kool &amp; The Gang, with a powerful lead vocalist in Kam Franklin and spot-on musicianship that is all too rare these days,\" says Shanachie Entertainment General Manager, Randall Grass. \"They've done a great job of building a base on their own and we at Shanachie are looking forward to taking them to the next level.\" The Suffers&rsquo; drive coupled with their can't lose attitude and serious chops have taken them from their beloved Houston to the world stage (they are the first band to break nationally out of Houston in a long time). Lead singer Kam Franklin has the distinction of being a spokesperson for Houston as she has been tapped by the city to appear in a national tourism advertisement. &ldquo;It means a lot to me that the city would trust me in such a grand way to represent them,&rdquo; shares the dynamic singer\/songwriter. &ldquo;Houston has played a huge part in making me who I am and introducing our music to the masses, and for that, we are forever grateful.&rdquo; The Suffers have played sold out shows in Japan and Latin America, turned out audiences at the Newport Folk Festival and Afropunk Festival and made believers of just about anyone who has experienced their live shows. \"We're a testament to teamwork and camaraderie resulting in things working out even when the odds are against a positive outcome,\" says drummer Nick Zamora. \"The wonderful thing about music is that it is ultimate universal communication,\" reflects trumpeter Jon Durbin.<\/p>\n<p>The Suffers exploded onto the scene in 2015 with their dazzling EP <strong><em>Make Some Room<\/em><\/strong>, which was followed by their critically heralded self-titled debut in 2016. The highly anticipated <strong><em>Everything Here <\/em><\/strong>is the band&rsquo;s most bold statement yet. Nick Zamora shares, &ldquo;We were nervous because we didn&rsquo;t know how to write an album while devoting so much time to touring and keeping our personal lives together at the same time. We started doing it when we could; on the road, at home, finding inspiration here and there. We wrote about our post-9 to 5 epiphanies, relationships and music that just felt good.&rdquo; As the album began to morph into creation the band trusted their vision. &ldquo;I think that the idea has always been to be as honest as we can,&rdquo; says Patrick Kelly. Kam<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Everything Here <\/em><\/strong>opens ceremoniously with a smooth and fun-loving head-nod to Houston. Paul Wall jumps on the intro as the background vocals sing<strong>, <\/strong>&ldquo;It might not be that pretty but it looks real good to me. It might not be your favorite city but it&rsquo;s really got a hold on me.&rdquo; Kam Franklin says, &ldquo;Not only does Paul Wall serve as an unofficial ambassador for the city, he is a hard working artist that brought this song the life we thought it was missing!&rdquo; The effervescently playful &ldquo;I Think I Love You&rdquo; follows with blustery horns and bluesy vocals. The song chronicles the moment when the universe throws you a curveball in the way of a new and unexpected love interest. Franklin shares, &ldquo;This song is about embracing that confidence that comes with not needing to depend on a lover, while still being open to the possibilities of new romance.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do Whatever,&rdquo; the album&rsquo;s second single, is a song the band nurtured for two years before they finally recorded it. During this evolution, it has come to stand as a sort of anthem for them on living your life on your own terms. It opens with soul-stirring horns, thumping bass lines and Kam laying down the law singing, \"Full on disclosure, I'm not here for exposure. I came to have a good time so let me shine...Do whatever feels right, all night, alright, alright!\" The driving rhythms and hip-hop tinged &ldquo;The One About Sace&rdquo; has some fun chronicling the journey of getting to know someone. With references to Nas and the film &ldquo;The Five Heartbeats,&rdquo; Kam asks questions to get to know her love interest better. The hopping Rhodes, skipping melody and fabulous orchestration on &ldquo;All I Want To Do&rdquo; reminds us of the virtues of following your heart. The song, which Nick Zamora penned while still in high school, showcases lyrics to live by: &ldquo;If it don&rsquo;t taste good, I don&rsquo;t have to eat it. If it don&rsquo;t fit well, I don&rsquo;t have to wear it. And if it ain&rsquo;t broke I don&rsquo;t have to fix it.&rdquo; <strong><em>Everything Here <\/em><\/strong>also highlights the tender ballad featuring lush strings and shimmering percussion, &ldquo;Sure To Remain,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Charlotte&rdquo; breaks down the walls of negativity and features Paul Wall once again. Franklin shares, &ldquo;The demo for this one was written in Charlotte, NC after a really rough day on the road. A few outsiders tried to break us down with their negativity, but we were not having it. The end result was us holding our heads up high and proceeding to do what we love most: creating smooth music that makes us and the masses happy!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August of 2017. Its devastation in many ways are comparable to the effects of Katrina. Despite the media&rsquo;s dissipating coverage, Houston is still recovering. &ldquo;After the Storm&rdquo; is a song that Kam wrote with her friend Lisa E. Harris during Hurricane Harvey. The song features Lyle Divinsky, lead singer for Denver-based funk band, The Motet. The arresting track opens with a percussive heartbeat that stops you in your tracks. Kam explains, &ldquo;In the days after the storm, the city enforced a mandatory curfew that meant everyone needed to be in their houses by 10pm every night. While visiting Lisa, we lost track of time, and ended up having a mandatory slumber party due to the curfew and ended up writing this song.&rdquo; The Suffers serve up some sharp-edged funk on the dance-inducing &ldquo;What You Said,&rdquo; which is all about communication as the lyrics exclaim &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you said, its how you said it. It&rsquo;s not what you did, it&rsquo;s how you did it!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The Suffers are family. Spend ten minutes with the band and you know that the ties that bind them go well beyond the music. They are truly a democracy in which every voice is heard and respected and they also love their mamas! On the heart-warming interlude &ldquo;A Word From Our Mammas,&rdquo; the band turn the mics on their mothers who are heard confessing their love for their children. The song &ldquo;Mammas&rdquo; very well could rival The Intruders seminal tribute to mama&rsquo;s everywhere. &ldquo;Bernard&rsquo;s Interlude&rdquo; features the baritone of pisces, poet and rapper Bun B. Kam&rsquo;s idea to feature a few MC&rsquo;s on the recording was inspired by Kanye West. &ldquo;I had a vision of getting a bunch of different rappers to do our interludes, similar to what Kanye did on his first few albums with the comedians. Instead of rapping, the vision was to show a different side of their personalities the world hasn&rsquo;t seen before. For Bun, I knew I wanted him to sing. Bun came in, and killed it on the first take.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The dub and reggae fueled title track takes us through the travails of a devastating breakup and was penned by Nick Zamora&rsquo;s brother and former band member Alex, who shared additional guitar duties. The sultry jazz vibes and delightfully unexpected key changes of &ldquo;You Only Call&rdquo; serves as a notice to all those who take but don&rsquo;t give back, while &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Be Here Tomorrow&rdquo; is a real soul\/blues showstopper. Kam Franklin&rsquo;s raspy and &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; vocals tell the story of a woman who has chosen to confront her cheating partner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little eerie, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s empowering,&rdquo; says Kam. &ldquo;She knows that he wants to be with her, so the power is in her hands. So, instead of automatically writing him off, she gives him the opportunity to explain why she should stay. This was one of my favorite songs to record on the album due to the fact that we brought in a choir of amazing singers to fill out the song.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With the release of <strong><em>Everything Here<\/em><\/strong>, The Suffers are bound to further endear die-hard fans and make believers of new ones. Jon Durbin says, &ldquo;I hope our music helps people and that our songs can be healing and inspirational.&rdquo; Kam Franklin concludes, &ldquo;We make music for ourselves, but the performances are 100 percent for the people. They are the reason we are on the road. They are the reason we get to eat. They are the reason for what we do. We&rsquo;d be nothing without them, and it&rsquo;s something we remind ourselves of every night.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TheSuffers_11_58_09_AM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thesuffers?ref=hl"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thesuffers\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/73ncl3RMnT90eLFhZdO2WU"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheSuffers"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.thesuffers.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":""},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:11:59 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-association":{"id":"4945","name":"The Association","friendly_url":"the-association","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p class=\"Normal2 P-3\"><span class=\"C-5\">In 1967, The Association&reg; made history being the first band&nbsp;<span class=\"C-6\">anywhere<\/span>&nbsp;to open a rock festival -<wbr \/>&nbsp;the now historic, Monterey Pop Festival.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal2 P-3\"><span class=\"C-5\">One of the most successful bands to come out of the 60&rsquo;s, they have sold millions of records, tapes, CDs and DVDs as well as earned a number of achievements including a&nbsp;<span class=\"C-7\">Golden Globe<\/span>nomination in 1970 for Best Original Song -<wbr \/>&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Goodbye Columbus<\/span>.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><span class=\"C-9\">7<\/span><span class=\"C-7\">&nbsp;<span class=\"C-9\">Grammy<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"C-9\">nominations<\/span><\/span>:&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>1967 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Rock &amp; Roll Group Performance: The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Cherish Lyrics<\/span><br \/>1967 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Rock &amp; Roll Recording: The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Cherish Lyrics<\/span><br \/>1967 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Vocal Group Performance: The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Cherish Lyrics<\/span><br \/>1968 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) or Instrumentalist(s):<br \/>The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Windy Lyrics<\/span><br \/>1968 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Contemporary Album: The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Insight Out<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body P-3\"><span class=\"C-5\">1968 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Contemporary Vocal Group: The Association,&nbsp;<span class=\"C-8\">Windy Lyrics<\/span><br \/>1968 -<wbr \/>&nbsp;Group Vocal Performance: The Association<span class=\"C-8\">, Never My Love<\/span><br \/><br \/>The Association has also received RIAA certifications for 6 gold and 3 platinum records.

After 14 years, HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS - JT W<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">oodruff (Vocals, Guitar), Mark McMillon (Guitar, Backing Vocals), Matt Ridenour (Bass, Backing Vocals), Chris Popadak (Drums) are still delivering monumental albums and maintaining their DIY mentality, while remaining dedicated to their longtime fans. Both their releases, The Silence in Black and White, and If Only You Were Lonely, received Gold certifications, as well as their single &ldquo;Saying Sorry&rdquo;. Says Woodruff: &ldquo;It's easy to stay inspired if you keep a level head. To last a decade you have to have strong fan support, strong relationships, and the ability to improvise. We have found that maintaining your core values will take you wherever you want to go in life.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>The forthcoming album, BAD FREQUENCIES was produced by the band and Nick Ingram (Hotel Books, Capital House Studio) , and mixed by Cameron Webb (Grammy Winner, Motorhead, NOFX, Social Distortion, Pennywise). The first single, &ldquo;Pink Hearts&rdquo; is about &ldquo;burning through relationships, because you are selfishly just having fun when you are young,&rdquo; says Woodruff. &ldquo;Eventually you have to wake up and grow up, and hope that you haven&rsquo;t cut someone too deep.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>With the release of BAD FREQUENCES, Hawthorne Heights hope to continue connecting with their unwavering fan base, and share music they&rsquo;re truly proud of with a wider audience. Says Woodruff: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always tried to be a shining light for our fans. Some of them look to us as a sign of hope, and we appreciate that. We try to write songs from bad experiences in our lives, in a way that they can relate to their bad experiences.

U.S.A.! U.S.A.!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not what one would expect to hear chanted vehemently from the members of an indie rock band in 2019&hellip; But Sego seems to get off on doing things one wouldn&rsquo;t expect from an LA indie band today. Being proficient at their instruments instead of relying on computer tracks to play their new album <em>Sego Sucks<\/em> live, recording said album in a church in far away Canada in the winter, thus committing to the deliberate notion of an album more than an amalgamation of 'laptop studio' singles. And yes, chanting &ldquo;USA, USA, USA&rdquo; as the main reprise of a reflective tune about entitlement culture. One must ask why? Why take it there? Or one may not ask and instead bounce and bop their way through each energetic turn, just happy to have their blood pump a little faster than the &ldquo;everything chill all the time&rdquo; pace that we&rsquo;ve all become accustomed to.<\/p>\n<p>And therein lies the trick of Sego. It&rsquo;s a gosh-damn choose your own adventure story of music for adrenaline huffers and introspective socio-philosophical types alike. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.<\/p>\n<p>I would say Sego hails from Utah, but when does anyone say that someone &lsquo;hails&rsquo; from anywhere other than in gratuitous band bios, ya know? Sego is not only aware that their Utah upbringing is different from most Angeleno transplants, but they exhibit a sense of pride in the perspective it has given them. Perhaps this is why singer Spencer Petersen finds ways to separate himself from the status quo. Like using a flip-phone still. And recording interludes with one of the many tape machines he has stock-piled in his studio. <em>Sego Sucks<\/em> is the cathartic result of a person like Spencer sorting his way through a natural resistance to being smothered by Modernism.<\/p>\n<p>Sonically, the 10-track LP is woven with the changes of becoming a four piece band. Originally Spencer Petersen and Thomas Carroll, the band added members Alyssa Davey on bass and Brandon McBride on guitars and keys in 2018. The sound became more focused, but the raucous spirit that has kept people sweating since the beginning is just as tangible and, dare I say, primal as ever. The extensive touring they&rsquo;ve done throughout North America, Europe, and the UK has also shown to be a strong influence. There&rsquo;s heat, there&rsquo;s resistance, there&rsquo;s intelligence. Did Sego fool us and write a modern day punk album that could be played on the radio?<\/p>\n<p>To go to a Sego show is to be standing amongst very different people having very different experiences. To your left is someone intently staring at Spencer digging through his many acid-tongued references trying to decipher his cryptic slant on absolutism. Behind you is a gear-nut scratching their heads trying to understand what far corner of the brain one can write such dissonantly triumphant guitar parts. In front of you is someone falling in love with Tom, Brandon or Alyssa depending on who the light falls upon in any given moment&hellip; or perhaps all 4 at the same time, the way it was always intended to happen when a band is really a band. But perhaps most common is the person to your right, who is dripping in sweat, dancing with their eyes closed and losing themselves completely in an anoetic experience particular to when music is being played live. And loud.<\/p>\n<p>While only on their sophomore album, Sego exhibits the kind of maturity in songwriting and pride in a live performance that makes for the band that your cool older brother worships and turns you on to the second your frontal lobe develops enough to spark your curiosity in taste.<\/p>\n<p>&ndash; Chris Hess (SWIMM)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SEGO_5_49_41_AM_4_9_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SegoMusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sego\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrhfgDOBQttroznnBa5iVBQ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sego_music"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/segosucks.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/03\/2019 11:00:00 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"big-head-todd-and-the-monsters":{"id":"5043","name":"Big Head Todd and the Monsters","friendly_url":"big-head-todd-and-the-monsters","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>Since their formation in the mid-&rsquo;80s, Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters have continued to evolve and explore, moving beyond their Colorado club circuit roots to become one of the most adventurous, respected and durable bands in America. Through constant touring and a zeal to travel down new musical avenues in the studio, BHTM (as their dedicated fans call them) have honed their collective stew of influences into a trademark hybrid sound that&rsquo;s immediately recognizable. Now, with Black Beehive, their maiden release on Shout! Factory (February 4, 2014), the quartet has made its most personal and poignant album to date, a collection of new studio tracks that, says co-founder and figurehead Todd Park Mohr, &ldquo;allows us to truly reach our audience through the language of the blues.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Recorded at Butcher Boy Studios in Chicago, Mohr&rsquo;s hometown of the past seven years, and produced and mixed by Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist Steve Jordan (whose previous production credits include John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Solomon Burke and Robert Cray), Black Beehive arrives a quarter-century after the group&rsquo;s debut album, Another Mayberry, first put Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters on the map beyond their home base. Today, the original trio&mdash;Mohr on guitar and vocals, Brian Nevin on drums and vocals and Rob Squires on bass and vocals&mdash;along with keyboardist\/pedal steel guitarist Jeremy Lawton, who joined in 2004, are still opening themselves to new possibilities even as they further explore their roots. &ldquo;It has some contemporary elements that bridge a gap between alternative pop and traditional blues,&rdquo; says Mohr about Black Beehive, whose title refers to the late British soul singer Amy Winehouse, the inspiration behind the album&rsquo;s title track.<\/p>\n<p>The band approached the recording in an old-school organic fashion, playing together in the studio, which Mohr describes as &ldquo;a big open space,&rdquo; and sticking to the basics. &ldquo;I played resonator guitar on almost every song and most of the album is kind of simple: guitar, slide guitar, drums and bass,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We only had two guests on the album. One was Eddie Shaw, who was Howlin&rsquo; Wolf&rsquo;s harmonica player for many years, and Ronnie Baker Brooks, who played guitar. And Steve Jordan played on almost every track&mdash;various things, percussion, rhythm guitar.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Jordan, whose incredible career began when he joined Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s band as a teenager, later going on to perform in the Saturday Night Live band, Paul Shaffer's World's Most Dangerous Band on Late Night with David Letterman, and backing John Belushi and Dan Akroyd when they toured as The Blues Brothers, has an unbelievable production roster but is also well-known as a drummer. A member of the John Mayer Trio, Jordan also toured and recorded with Keith Richards and the X-pensive Winos, joined Eric Clapton for his 2006 European tour, and has also worked with Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, B.B. King, James Brown and more.<\/p>\n<p>Mohr first met Jordan through the legendary guitarist Hubert Sumlin, who died in 2011. &ldquo;We were planning to have an 80th birthday party for Hubert,&rdquo; says Todd, &ldquo;and Steve was the musical director. When Hubert passed away it ended up being a tribute at the Apollo Theater: Eric Clapton and Billy Gibbons and Keith Richards&mdash;there were probably 35 incredible musicians at this thing. I was immediately awestruck by Steve&rsquo;s command of the material and his understanding of it and his ability to get it done on short notice with all these people. I thought this guy would be an unbelievable producer for me to work with. I sent him some demos and he was up for it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As he began writing material for the album, Mohr drew from both his own life experiences and events in the news. The title track was written following Winehouse&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;I love her voice and her performances, and obviously her shenanigans were part of her persona,&rdquo; says Mohr. Several other songs were also ripped from the headlines, including &ldquo;We Won&rsquo;t Go Back,&rdquo; which Mohr penned about the 2010 Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East, and &ldquo;Fear, Greed and Ignorance,&rdquo; whose topical lyrics declare that it&rsquo;s those three dishonorable traits that are &ldquo;driving you America off the edge of the road.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Not every track is quite so pointed, however. &ldquo;Hubert&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; is a nod to the late Mr. Sumlin, while album opener &ldquo;Hey Delila&rdquo; is Mohr&rsquo;s tribute to another blues giant, Memphis Minnie. &ldquo;I happened to acquire a great example of her instrument, which was a 1941 Spanish National resonator guitar. Plus, she has an incredible life story,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Everything About You&rdquo; is dedicated to NASA, who called upon BHTM to awaken the Discovery space shuttle crew with their song &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; in 2011, marking the first time live music was ever used for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Among the album&rsquo;s other tunes, &ldquo;Josephina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seven State Lines&rdquo; are what Mohr describes simply as &ldquo;blues-based themes,&rdquo; while &ldquo;I Get Smooth&rdquo; is &ldquo;a comedy piece.&rdquo; The cautionary tale &ldquo;Travelin&rsquo; Light&rdquo; is the story of lovers who &ldquo;threw away our hearts and fled&rdquo; and the moving &ldquo;Forever Bonnie&rdquo; is based on a true story of a &ldquo;gentleman who got a love letter delivered to him 53 years later by the Postal Service.&rdquo; Black Beehive also includes, as a bonus track, Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters&rsquo; burning take on the Jimmy Reed blues classic &ldquo;Baby What You Want Me To Do,&rdquo; a song that Jordan requested they cut.<\/p>\n<p>For BHTM, Black Beehive serves as both a reaffirmation of the band&rsquo;s roots and a step into the next 25 years. Founded as a trio in Boulder, Colorado in 1986, Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters quickly built a strong reputation on the local club circuit. As word of their soulful and intense live show traveled around the nation they found themselves filling larger and larger venues. BHTM have now played Denver&rsquo;s historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre more than 20 times, and are embedded in the fabric of Colorado&rsquo;s music scene.<\/p>\n<p>Beginning with Another Mayberry in 1989, critics noticed what audiences at BHTM live shows already knew. The All Music Guide praised the &ldquo;subtlety of Mohr&rsquo;s lyrics&rdquo; and his &ldquo;individual world view.&rdquo; But it was the follow-up, 1990&rsquo;s Midnight Radio, that truly established the band as a creative force to be reckoned with. Its popularity led to a major label contract and the release of the platinum-selling Sister Sweetly in 1993. With subsequent albums such as 1994&rsquo;s Strategem and 1997&rsquo;s Beautiful World, the band earned a place among the top names on the jam band circuit, solidified by 1998&rsquo;s Live Monsters, the first official concert recording by Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters. Riviera was released in 2002, followed by 2004&rsquo;s Crimes of Passion, of which The London Times stated \"American rock doesn't get anymore classy than this.\" Later that year, Live at the Fillmore was released to critical praise. All Music Guide called the release, the band&rsquo;s first with Jeremy Lawton, &ldquo;loud, proud, and full of righteous raw ambience.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The band, which has always proudly controlled its own business dealings and marketing, gave away 2007&rsquo;s All the Love You Need through their email list, radio stations, and magazines. Their ninth studio album, Rocksteady, followed in 2010. Said Examiner.com, &ldquo;With Rocksteady, the Colorado boys prove they can sprinkle in a plethora of differing music styles and still rock.&rdquo; 2011&rsquo;s 100 Years of Robert Johnson, the album preceding Black Beehive, found the group paying tribute to the pioneering bluesman while performing as Big Head Blues Club (along with other notable blues legends, including B. B. King, Charlie Musselwhite, Cedric Burnside, David &ldquo;Honeyboy&rdquo; Edwards, Sumlin, Ruthie Foster, and Lightnin&rsquo; Malcolm). The band toured behind the album with a few of the guest artists, marking some of the final performances by both Edwards and Sumlin. Mohr paid tribute to Sumlin in 2012 when he served as a featured artist at his tribute show at the Apollo Theatre.<\/p>\n<p>With all of that history behind them, it would be easy for Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters to play the nostalgia card and fall back on past glories, but that&rsquo;s of no interest to them. BHTM still performs, and devoutly loves, the material that first brought them to their fans &ndash; material they now approach with a fresh, seasoned perspective. &ldquo;As a writer and as a human being there&rsquo;s a big difference between being 21 and 47,&rdquo; says Mohr. &ldquo;Having said that, I think a lot of those compositions are still lyrically sound, even though it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that I would have had the experience to write about the stuff I did. Obviously, I think the band has gotten better over the years because when you develop yourself you continue to improve, and I think we have improved musically. As a writer, I&rsquo;m really pleased with where I&rsquo;m at right now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of it had to do with my experience with the Robert Johnson project,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;That had a large impact on how I looked at music. For a large portion of my career, I&rsquo;ve been trying to reproduce the success of Sister Sweetly, just as a touchstone of &lsquo;this is a pop song, or rock-pop.&rsquo; Pop songs have pretty narrow rules when it comes down to it. Generally you need a chorus and a bridge. The blues material from Robert Johnson&rsquo;s day, the prewar blues, was so fascinating to me because of the fact that it is pop music but there are no choruses. It&rsquo;s a different way of having repetition and themes and a different goal for a pop song. The music is shared by everybody because it&rsquo;s passed down through tradition. The whole spirit of what one is going for is radically different than pop and that really became exciting for me because I could see a new way to reach people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters launch their extensive national tour behind Black Beehive in January&mdash;which will continue through the summer and hit most major markets&mdash;they will be honing the album&rsquo;s ageless blues along the way, and simultaneously affirming their own longevity. It&rsquo;s clear that they possess a rare musical wholeness that has not only survived for 25 plus years, but still has them looking forward to creating music together night after night. &ldquo;The other guys have shown great support of my songwriting and what I&rsquo;m able to do, and all of the band members bring a lot to the plate, both musically and as a unit,&rdquo; says Mohr. &ldquo;No one ever expects a band to last this long.

As work around the album came together, <strong>CAROUSEL KINGS<\/strong> toured the UK for the first time and played select dates of the final Vans Warped Tour. &ldquo;As soon as we got back from Europe we kind of went into hibernation and began creating what would become <em>Plus Ultra<\/em>,&rdquo; says vocalist and founder David Alexander.<\/p>\n<p>Musically, <em>Plus Ultra<\/em> goes far beyond the limitations of pop-punk, adding a deeper and subtle, diverse selection of material, including a whopping ten guest appearances.<em> &ldquo;Plus Ultra<\/em> is the first album we have had a female voice on which we are very stoked about!&rdquo; exclaims Alexander. &ldquo;In addition to having the great Lexxe on &lsquo;Move Slow,&rsquo; this is the first album we have experimented with these different sounds, including a ukulele and saxophone feature spot on &lsquo;Shelter,&rsquo; and lots of electronic sounds throughout.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAROUSEL KINGS<\/strong> sought to build on the foundation of 2017 critic&rsquo;s favorite <em>Charm City, <\/em>and expand on <em>Plus Ultra<\/em>. <em>&ldquo;Plus Ultra<\/em> is a culmination of years of growth and we&rsquo;re ready to work our hardest, create joy through music, and light a new fire under our own asses,&rdquo; promises guitarist and vocalist William Barovick.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Plus Ultra translates to simply mean &lsquo;further beyond,&rsquo; but it has many different meanings and an interesting history behind it,&rdquo; Alexander states. &ldquo;Its origins date back to the King of Spain, Charles V, who used the phrase as his motto.

The towns are small. And the name is HARDY.<\/p>\n<p>Big Loud artist HARDY grew up on classic rock in Philadelphia, Miss., a town of about 7,500 in the country setting of Neshoba County. So when fans hear the music on his four-song EP for the label, <em>This Ole Boy<\/em>, they&rsquo;re getting the real deal. The songs are bold and proud, the voice is commanding and the lyrics are centered on farms, in the backwoods and mostly in America&rsquo;s heartland.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love that lifestyle, and that&rsquo;s what I want to talk about,&rdquo; he says unapologetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really a love song dude. If I&rsquo;m going down that road, it&rsquo;s a song like &lsquo;This Ole Boy&rsquo; where it&rsquo;s a redneck- in-love kind of thing. People that are like me, or people who still live in small towns, still love that and want to hear that. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m who I am as an artist.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>HARDY&rsquo;s artistic identity is notably focused on <em>This Ole Boy<\/em>. His voice is gritty in &ldquo;4x4,&rdquo; soulful in the background vocals of &ldquo;This Ole Boy&rdquo; and edgy in the stack of HARDY harmonies in &ldquo;Rednecker.&rdquo; The productions&rsquo; mix of swamp rock and country walks a line between strutting sarcasm and communal congeniality. And the incessant word play &ndash; where else does &ldquo;quatro&rdquo; rhyme with &ldquo;macho?&rdquo; &ndash; marks HARDY as a smart guy with an uncommon sense of humor.<\/p>\n<p>Some of those traits are a direct result of his songwriting prowess. HARDY moved to Nashville to pursue the elusive art of matching words with chords and melodies, and 2018 became a breakthrough year for him. He was one of three writers on the Morgan Wallen\/Florida Georgia Line collaboration &ldquo;Up Down,&rdquo; a #1 platinum-selling country single built on HARDY&rsquo;s original idea: &ldquo;We live it up down here.&rdquo; He snagged another hit as a co-writer of FGL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Simple.&rdquo; And he took part in Seth Ennis&rsquo; &ldquo;Call Your Mama,&rdquo; a lump-in-your-throat ballad that started its chart journey in fall 2018.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, HARDY was so focused on writing that he didn&rsquo;t really pursue his budding recording career. It actually came looking for him. FGL&rsquo;s Tyler Hubbard and the duo&rsquo;s producer, Joey Moi, were both convinced there was a place for his talent in the marketplace and offered to help him make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps unintentionally &ndash; perhaps on purpose &ndash; FGL helped him say yes by putting HARDY on stage three different times during its 2018 summer tour. He hit the road several weekends to write with the duo, and they brought him out to take Wallen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Up Down&rdquo; part at the Country Stampede in Manhattan, Kansas; the Country LakeShake in Chicago; and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. HARDY was amped and animated in the role, as if he&rsquo;d been playing in front of thousands for years. And the crowd reaction sealed the deal.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Playing those places and those people singing back to you, that whole thing put it in perspective,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That is an incredible feeling. It&rsquo;s just unexplainable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, HARDY comes to the table as an artist with a strong view of who he is, thanks to his experiences in Mississippi. Philadelphia spawned two previous country music successes &ndash; Grand Ole Opry member Marty Stuart and songwriter\/producer Derek George (Bryan White, Randy Houser) &ndash; and they certainly showed it was possible to make it in the business. But HARDY&rsquo;s original exposure to music came from his dad, who consistently had classic rock blasting when he took his son on the 15-mile commute from the house to the family&rsquo;s chicken farm and back. HARDY pitched in on a job that was brutal to the senses &ndash; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think I could go in a chicken house now,&rdquo; he says &ndash; but he learned the value of hard work. And the exposure to smart hooks and distinct musical identities of the music his father listened to made a permanent imprint.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I like Pink Floyd a lot,&rdquo; HARDY says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my favorite band. Thanks to my dad, I loved <em>The Wall <\/em>and <em>Dark Side of the Moon <\/em>growing up, and once I got older, I realized how metaphorical and parallel their writing is, and how you understand it. I really appreciate, in all genres, creativity that sonically nobody has ever heard before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>His dad took him to his first two concerts &ndash; Aerosmith, in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1999; and KISS, in Jackson, Mississippi, in 2000 &ndash; but when HARDY wrote his first song at age 18, it set him on the path toward making music a vocation. That initial composition, &ldquo;Caroline,&rdquo; had the singer meeting a girl in a grocery store and obsessing about her, even though he would never encounter her again.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was just so simple and not thought out,&rdquo; he says with a laugh. &ldquo;There were little holes in the storyline. It&rsquo;s interesting to think about it looking back now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But it got a reaction. His parents, of course, liked it. And when he played it for a few classmates at junior college, they liked it, too. HARDY started playing it at parties and creating a little buzz, though it was the only song he knew. That spurred him to write a few more.<\/p>\n<p>When he heard Eric Church&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homeboy,&rdquo; HARDY realized that rock had found a new home in country music, and it created a deeper appreciation for the genre, which had always been there in the background in Philadelphia.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, HARDY&rsquo;s sister &ndash; Nashville makeup artist Madison Hardy Dennis &ndash; was going to school at Music City&rsquo;s Belmont University, and when he visited her in February 2010, the experience was life-changing.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Music was everywhere &ndash; I had no idea,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I found out about publishing deals and that you could make a living writing songs. That was over one weekend, so when I went back home I told my mom, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m moving to Nashville.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>HARDY enrolled in the Recording Industry Management program at Middle Tennessee State University and majored in songwriting, mentored by instructor Rick Carnes, who composed Garth Brooks&rsquo; &ldquo;Longneck Bottle,&rdquo; The Whites&rsquo; &ldquo;Hangin&rsquo; Around&rdquo; and Reba McEntire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Even Get The Blues.&rdquo; HARDY periodically posted performances of his own songs on social media, and another relative &ndash; Dennis Matkosky, first cousin to HARDY&rsquo;s grandfather &ndash; reached out. Matkosky was an established songwriter, known for Michael Sembello&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maniac,&rdquo; Keith Urban&rsquo;s &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll Think Of Me&rdquo; and LeAnn Rimes&rsquo; &ldquo;I Need You.&rdquo; Matkosky liked HARDY&rsquo;s work, and within a few months, he signed HARDY to his own independent publishing company.<\/p>\n<p>HARDY met FGL&rsquo;s Tyler Hubbard at a parking lot party on Music Row in 2012, right as &ldquo;Cruise&rdquo; was being released, and didn&rsquo;t see him again for several years. In the meantime, HARDY landed cuts by Tyler Farr and Walker McGuire, and when he got a chance to start writing with FGL at their concert sites on the road, his acquaintance with Hubbard turned into a full-fledged friendship. Beginning in January 2017, he was a frequent sidekick on tour, writing with them on their bus during the day before their concerts. In fact, &ldquo;Throwback&rdquo; &ndash; the newest song on <em>This Ole Boy <\/em>&ndash; was written on the bus at the Iowa State Fair in August 2018, just weeks before the EP&rsquo;s release.<\/p>\n<p>The release provides a strong base point for HARDY as an artist, representative of the hard-edged music, the easy-going people and the slow-changing nature of the world at the heart of a rural community.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of where I pull from is just being from a small town,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;People live a little slower and a little more behind, whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or bad thing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With <em>This Ole Boy<\/em>, HARDY provides a solid opening salvo to establish himself as an artist, honed in on the sounds and stories at the core of his Southern heritage. But it&rsquo;s just a starting point, a place to launch an artist whose combination of country imagery, Southern rock sounds and blue-collar vocals is intrinsically relatable.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This stuff is my favorite and the most true to me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but we will mix it up along the way, slowly but surely. I don&rsquo;t want to scare anybody off, but we&rsquo;ll give a taste here and there and hopefully by the end it will be a well-rounded sound.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A big sound. About small towns. A HARDY representation.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Hardy_3_32_41_PM_3_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Hardy\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hardy\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5QNm7E7RU2m64l6Gliu8Oy?si=3pzEUwL5SE6KJt30S0VaBw"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hardymusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/hardyofficial.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCfaTFCTvP8LVmJ4vZNUIRyQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 12:16:29 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"nikki-jean":{"id":"5160","name":"Nikki Jean","friendly_url":"nikki-jean","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>It&rsquo;s hard to place Nikki Jean in time or space.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A born drifter, through decades of musical influences, the half dozen states she&rsquo;s called home, and the disparate events that have created an enigma of an artist.&nbsp; While those in her cohort dug through crates of music from bygone eras for their sample value, she was reading their sheet music like novels, while writing a novel of her own and it reads like a love song to hip hop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The early signs were all there.&nbsp; The girl from St. Paul who cried when Irving Berlin died as a child and snuck into De La Soul concerts in junior high&nbsp; would become the artist who worked out of the Roots studio and went on to write songs with Bob Dylan and Burt Bacharach.&nbsp; &nbsp; How fitting that the song she is most known for &ldquo;Hip Hop Saved My Life&rdquo;, which she penned with longtime collaborator Lupe Fiasco, off the Grammy nominated classic, &ldquo;The Cool&rdquo;, was the song that allowed her to do so?<\/p>\n<p>And who does that?&nbsp; Who comes off Kanye&rsquo;s historic &ldquo;Glow In The Dark&rdquo; Tour only to turn away from the flashing lights opting for a path less traveled.

While his music, an amalgamation of roots styles in their rawest form, discusses heavyweight issues like murder, homelessness, tyranny, and injustice, his personal style is lighthearted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at dark, but I&rsquo;m not a particularly unhappy person,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to make enough money to buy a Porsche.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Part of Taylor&rsquo;s appeal is his contrasting character traits. But it is precisely this element of surprise that makes him one of the most compelling artists to emerge in recent years. In fact, Guitar Player magazine writes, &ldquo;Otis Taylor is arguably the most relevant blues artist of our time.&rdquo; Whether it&rsquo;s his unique instrumentation (he fancies banjo and cello), or it&rsquo;s the sudden sound of a female vocal, or a seemingly upbeat optimistic song takes a turn for the forlorn, what remains consistent is poignant storytelling based in truth and history. On his sixth CD, Double V, Taylor unleashes intimate tales as he produces an aural excursion inspired by an unconventional childhood.<\/p>\n<p>Otis Mark Taylor was born in Chicago in 1948. After his uncle was shot to death, his family moved to Denver where an adolescent&rsquo;s interest in blues and folk was cultivated. Both his parents were big music fans; &ldquo;I was raised with jazz musicians,&rdquo; Taylor relates. &ldquo;My dad worked for the railroad and knew a lot of jazz people. He was a socialist and real bebopper.&rdquo; His mother, Sarah, a tough as nails woman with liberal leanings, had a penchant for Etta James and Pat Boone. Young Otis spent time at the Denver Folklore Center where he bought his first instrument, a banjo. He used to play it while riding his unicycle to high school. The Folklore Center was also the place where he first heard Mississippi John Hurt and country blues. He learned to play guitar and harmonica and by his mid-teens, he formed his first groups&rsquo; the Butterscotch Fire Department Blues Band and later the Otis Taylor Blues Band. He ventured overseas to London where he performed for a brief time until he returned to the U.S. in the late 60s. His next project became the T&amp;O Short Line with legendary Deep Purple singer\/guitarist Tommy Bolin. Stints with the 4-Nikators and Zephyr followed before he decided to take a hiatus from the music business in 1977. During this time he established a successful career as an antiques dealer and also began coaching a professional bicycle team. They ranked 4th in the nation and were known for having two of the best African-American riders in the country.<\/p>\n<p>After years of prodding from his musical mentor (all-star bass player Kenny Passarelli), Otis returned to the stage. It was 1995, in an intimate room in Boulder Colorado&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hill&rdquo; district. He was joined on stage by sideman to the stars, Kenny Passarelli, and ace guitarist Eddie Turner. A magazine writer on hand reported: &ldquo;The combination was magic, Taylor&rsquo;s unique singing style blended perfectly with Passarelli&rsquo;s rock steady virtuosity Turnet&rsquo;s rock-roll tinged riffs.&rdquo; Response to the &ldquo;one-time gig&rdquo; was so strong, Taylor decided to return to the music scene, playing select dates with Passarelli and Turner.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later he released Blue Eyed Monster (Shoelace Music), which riveted the blues world and marked the emergence of a singer\/songwriter who has, in his own words, &ldquo;a way of saying something that seems to be more intense.&rdquo; Further, he says, &ldquo;you can definitely see how I was forming. There was the Christmas song about a guy that killed his parents. Definitely getting ready to go that way, you know?&rdquo; In 1998, he raised more eyebrows with When Negroes Walked the Earth (Shoelace) an album replete with unapologetic lyrics, stark instrumentation and a gut-wrenching delivery. Playboy magazine described it as &ldquo;minimalist blues in the John Lee Hooker mode.&rdquo; Critics and music fans took notice and his talents as a vivid storyteller and accomplished guitar player were solidified. His gifts were further recognized in Summer 2000, with a composition fellowship from the Sundance Institute in Park City, UT.<\/p>\n<p>If Taylor &lsquo;s first two recordings cast a spell on the music world, listeners were officially entranced by White African (2001, NorthernBlues Music), his most direct and personal statement about the experiences of African-Americans. He addressed the lynching of his great-grandfather and the death of his uncle. Brutality became his concern in songs that fearlessly explored the history of race relations and social injustices. With this disc Taylor was officially blazing a trail. He earned four W.C. Handy nominations and won the award for &ldquo;Best New Artist Debut.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>White African was barely in record stores when he began writing the songs that would comprise Respect The Dead. Released in 2002, it made him a contender for two Handys in 2003; &ldquo;Best Acoustic Artist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Contemporary Blues Album.&rdquo; Last year, he bent conventions again with his debut effort for Telarc Records, Truth Is Not Fiction. Here, Taylor took a decidedly electric, almost psychedelic path forging a sound which he describes as &ldquo;trance-blues.&rdquo; Music critics were indeed captivated as the disc received lavish praise from USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, NPR and a nod from the Downbeat Critics Poll for &ldquo;Blues Album of the Year.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He quickly followed up Truth with Double V, which marked his entrance as a producer and a collaboration with his daughter Cassie, who sings and plays bass. The album scored him a Downbeat Critics Poll win for an unheard-of second consecutive year, while Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, Blender, and CNN all gave their thumbs-up. But perhaps the most meaningful accolade came from Living Blues Reader&rsquo;s Poll, which awarded Taylor (along with Etta James) with the &ldquo;Best Blues Entertainer&rdquo; title in 2004.<\/p>\n<p>Telarc released Below the Fold, Taylor&rsquo;s seventh CD, in the summer of 2005. The album is a set of stylistically varied songs that point to a blues-based center but are awash with Appalachian country overtones and moody, psychedelic rock. Once again, the critics raved. Downbeat gave the album four stars, noting that Taylor &ldquo;has a poet&rsquo;s soul, with a deep respect for the history of blacks in America and an unshakable curiosity about the human condition.&rdquo; Paste called him &rdquo; a country-folk version of spontaneous, talking-blues master John Lee Hooker.&rdquo; The New Yorker dubbed his sound &ldquo;Velvet Underground Railroad,&rdquo; and went on to proclaim that &ldquo;he may drone but he never stays still, and when he moves he&rsquo;s always heading toward places you haven&rsquo;t seen.&rdquo; At year&rsquo;s end, Below the Fold landed in the number 12 slot on the Chicago Tribune&rsquo;s Top 20 album list.<\/p>\n<p>And if the brilliant songwriting and the haunting voice weren&rsquo;t enough to turn the heads of audiences and critics alike, Taylor has also proven his instrumental chops with two consecutive Blues Music Awards nominations (2005 and 2006) for Best Instrumentalist in the banjo category.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to traditional touring and recording, Taylor spearheads a Blues in the Schools program called &ldquo;Writing the Blues.&rdquo; Conceived by his wife, he appears at elementary schools and universities around the country to offer advice, enlighten, and mentor students about the blues. &ldquo;I start by asking them to write down what makes them sad; fears, disappointments, losses, whatever. It is just amazing to see some of these nuggets, these incredible thoughts. They are often simple sentences but so real, so sad, so true, so pure.&rdquo; For Taylor, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to connect with others and help others to connect with themselves. And, it allows him to do his part in ensuring that the blues, and the ability to share life experiences will continue in the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>Taylor resides in Boulder, Colorado, where he lives with his wife.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_OtisTaylorandThePsychedelicBanjoPosse_3_23_27_PM_4_5_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OtisTaylorBand"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.otistaylor.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=am4GcbBrdMA&feature=related"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5Y1mtkFXBCx0dyL93Wt54T"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OtisTaylorBand"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2019 03:24:23 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"oxymorrons":{"id":"5094","name":"Oxymorrons","friendly_url":"oxymorrons","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>When you think about Alternative music in 2019 Oxymorrons undoubtedly come to mind.

Hailing from the Louisiana city, rising indie pop six-piece Sweet Crude know there&rsquo;s so much more to be found and appreciated: a richness in culture and history, which they&rsquo;ve deftly woven into the foundation of their work.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>- Consequence of Sound<\/p>\n<p>Over the past few years, Sweet Crude has managed to take the music and language of Louisiana and produce a completely fresh music that thrusts century-old traditions into the present. The six-piece band consistently delivers exciting shows featuring enough drums for a small marching band, exuberantly bellowed harmonies, and lyrics that jump from English to Louisiana French in a single verse. Boasting surnames like Marceaux and Chachere, Sweet Crude seeks to reconnect with their lineage in a way that draws on their own modern influences, while nodding to the music and language of their ancestors.<\/p>\n<p>The members of Sweet Crude all hail from South Louisiana, a region which still holds onto its unique culture and way of life stronger than anywhere else in the United States. That said, many of those elements are fading with time as American culture gradually becomes more homogenized. This trend can be seen most directly in the gradual fade of the Louisiana French language. The members of Sweet Crude grew up with grandparents and great grandparents that spoke the region&rsquo;s native dialect as their first language, yet with each successive generation, that language gets lost to time. Instead of singing the language in its usual music genres, zydeco and cajun, Sweet Crude draws on their own influences coming mainly from New Orleans music, pop, and indie rock to produce a sound that is accessible to today&rsquo;s generation. They are taking the language out the museum, weaving it in with English, and giving it fresh legs and relevancy for years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Sweet Crude released their debut LP Cr&eacute;atures in April of 2017 on Rhyme and Reason Records and followed the release with performances at major US festivals such as Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and High Sierra. In addition to headlining their own US tour in April and May of 2017, they hit the road with their dear friends, Tank and the Bangas, on a sold-out nationwide club tour that lasted through the summer and fall. The band also won the Big Easy Award for &ldquo;Best Rock Band&rdquo; in New Orleans in 2017. The other two nominees were The Revivalists and Mutemath.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, Sweet Crude is scheduled to record their major label debut album (to be announced in Spring 2018), tour Europe, and return to the US festival circuit.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SweetCrude_7_41_51_AM_4_9_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SweetCrudeBand\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sweetcrudeband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6SkFGEcHApSGM7xXGn5u64"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweetcrudeband"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/sweetcrudeband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sweetcrudeband"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/16\/2019 11:27:55 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"leonid--friends":{"id":"5146","name":"Leonid & Friends","friendly_url":"leonid--friends","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>In just three short years, Moscow-based&nbsp;<strong>LEONID &amp; FRIENDS<\/strong>&nbsp;have blown the minds of legions of fans with their uncanny ability to capture the spirit, musicality and fire of American supergroup Chicago.

Tenille&rsquo;s dream of performing took root at the age of 8, when a neighbor overheard her singing a Shania Twain song in her backyard and encouraged her mom to&nbsp;&nbsp; help her pursue music. After years of hard work, Tenille began making the long trip to Nashville to advance her songwriting skills. Her determination and talent led to steadily increasing successes as she earned a publishing deal in Nashville, and saw her 2016 debut EP peak at #1 on the iTunes Canada Country Album Chart as well as crack the top 100 on the U.S. iTunes Country Album Chart. She has already surpassed 3 million streams on Apple Music and 4 million total streams.<\/p>\n<p>Tenille&rsquo;s hauntingly mysterious song &ldquo;Cold Feet&rdquo; has helped grow her fan base with a popular video that reached #1 on the CMT 12 Pack Countdown. The song has also received much critical acclaim, including a rare feature article on an independent release by Tom Roland in Billboard Country. Arts released her first full-length album &ldquo;Rebel Child&rdquo; in October 2017 having co-written 10 of the 11 songs. It debuted at #2 on the iTunes Canada Top&nbsp;&nbsp; Country Albums Chart, #12 on the All-Genres Chart, and reached #17 in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Tenille caught the attention of Popculture.com and was recently named a 2018 Artist to Watch.

Their freshman album, Future Me Hates Me, also produced by Pearce, arrives on August 10th; fans of artists like Sleater-Kinney and Best Coast should remain on high alert for the first full-length from their new favorite band.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TheBeths_7_38_15_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"5:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thebethsnz"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lizstokedstokes\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7DjwIxbe8kpw4pqnzAMoin"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lizstokedstokes"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/thebeths.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/CarparkRecords\/search?query=%22The+Beths%22"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/16\/2019 11:27:05 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"black-pumas":{"id":"5033","name":"Black Pumas","friendly_url":"black-pumas","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>Psychedelic soul based in Austin, TX.

Victoria leaned into the microphone with a correction, \"Adia Victoria does not sing Americana, Adia Victoria sings the blues.\" From there, the artist let her guitar and powerful lyrics speak for her. After a self-released single that drew the attention of&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone<\/em>&nbsp;and others, Victoria continued to dazzle and confound with her first studio album,&nbsp;<em>Beyond the Bloodhounds<\/em>. The album takes its title from a line in&nbsp;<em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave&nbsp;<\/em>Girl by Harriet Jacobs. Just as Jacobs sought to get beyond the reach of her master's bloodhounds, Victoria is always reaching beyond the facile notions of what a Black woman artist should look like and sound like.<br \/><br \/>Instead of following the model of the folks that she saw around her who had been worn down by white supremacy, poverty, and oppression in the rural South Carolina town she grew up in, Victoria set off to shape a life of her own making. She dropped out of school and worked a series of odd jobs. At 18 she went to Paris and then spent time in Brooklyn, Atlanta, and now is based in Nashville. Victoria is a polymath who studied ballet, acting, wrote poetry, before finding a home in the blues. It was when a friend gave Victoria an acoustic guitar that things began to click. \"I fell in love with the practice, the discipline of learning. It was the first time in my life that I felt capable of learning and progressing at something.\" According to Victoria, this practice was a lifesaver. \"I don't know if I would be alive if I had not found that. Had I not found this outlet of expression. Probably in prison or dead.\"<br \/><br \/>In the wake of&nbsp;<em>Beyond the Bloodhounds<\/em>, touring, press and enormous expectations a lesser artist would have just rested on her laurels. Instead, Victoria released two short albums that show the immense wingspan of her talent and curiosity.&nbsp;<em>How It Feels<\/em>&nbsp;is a French-language short album that reimagines French pop classics with a blueswoman's edge. Victoria returned to her roots with the EP&nbsp;<em>Baby Blues<\/em>, a trio of classic blues covers that first inspired her.<br \/><br \/>A mere two years after&nbsp;<em>Beyond the Bloodhounds<\/em>, Adia Victoria returns with her<br \/>second full-length studio album,&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>. After a season of dealing with others trying to define, claim, and name her art and artistry, Victoria went inward. \"I found when I went back home that the thing that disturbed me the most was the lack of activity. Having to deal with myself once again on an intimate level.\"<br \/><br \/>Reading and literature helped her find her way back in. The title of the album comes from Tillie Olsen's&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>, which deals with the myriad ways that the stories of oppressed people's stories have been silenced over the years, even though they continued to create despite being ignored. \"I struggled to write this album in a way that I never had to before. I took for granted I guess my freedom and my alone time and I felt that something had been taken away from me. And I felt like I didn't have a voice anymore. This album was the therapy that I needed to find that voice that had been silenced.\"<br \/><br \/>We find a voice in full holler on&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>. The listener is thrust into a completely formed world that opens with a twisted creation tale. \"Clean,\" is reminiscent of the story of the Garden of Eden, but instead of withering under God's judgement for her shame, our protagonist announces that \"First of all \/ There is no God \/ Because I killed my God.\" This bold act instills in her \"The kind of calm I hope to keep.\" Any student of stories or life knows that this is can only be the beginning. A calm so deep must be earned along the way.<br \/><br \/><em>Silences<\/em>&nbsp;is at its heart the mythic journey of a woman coming back to herself. \"It's just very much this character is acting out from various oppressions. You've been held down, you've been smothered, and she reaches her breaking point.\" From this departure, the album moves her protagonist out into the world where she meets up with the devil and her own desires for her life in the uptempo rockers \"Pacolet Road\" and \"Different Kind Of Love.\" In the next movement, we find a woman daunted and damaged but still resolved. Once we get to \"The Needle's Eye\" and \"Cry Wolf\" she's gained some well-earned maturity down in the dark of the world. In&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>, Victoria brings the topics of mental illness, drug addiction, sexism, and all the things that try to consume the very lives of women attempting to make a world of their own making to the forefront. The album closes with \"Get Lonely,\" a plaintive, urgent ballad that our hero could be imploring to \"get lonely\" with a lover. Or she just as easily could be pleading with this new woman in the mirror that she has found along her journey to be still and marvel at all that she has created and survived.<br \/><br \/>Just as Victoria has been intentional about creating the kind of life that she wanted to live, she's done the same thing with her collaborators. The band has changed a lot like Destiny's Child since the first album, to get the perfect presentation and I think I finally found it. Victoria's guys are Mason Hickman- Lead Guitar, Jason Harris- Bass, Peter Eddins- Keys, Timothy Beaty aka Knapps- Drums, Chazen Singleton- Horns, and Austin Wilhote aka Will&eacute;- Horns. \"No. This is the greatest possession that I have. I have a bunch of guys now that I've been with and they allow me the ability and the space to command them, to direct them. They have faith in me.\"<br \/><br \/>When it was time to record&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>&nbsp;with Aaron Dessner of The National who has also produced albums for Sharon Van Etten, Frightened Rabbit, Mumford &amp; Sons, Local Natives, and more, Victoria remained hesitant. \"I want to let you into my art, but I was so very, very cautious. And I just found that as a human being and as a fellow artist he had the warmth and the understanding and the respect that you don't come across too often in this industry. He opened his home and his studio to me and my guys and it was like there was no ego. We were just free to experiment and together and we got work done.\" With Adia Victoria's steady hand and fearless vision at the helm,&nbsp;<em>Silences<\/em>&nbsp;does indeed get work done. Of the recording process, Dessner notes, \"\"From the very beginning of our collaboration, it was clear to me that Adia's vision for this album had a cohesive and very particular narrative thread. It was incredibly rewarding to help realize it. The substantive nature of her writing and strength of Adia's lyrics really guided us through the entire recording process. Every sound and direction, whether subversive, experimental or leaning into a groove, it was all in service of her broader vision and the text. Ultimately, the album is both an incredibly personal narrative of Adia's journey and a powerful, broader statement of resistance.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AdiaVictoria_4_30_12_PM_4_3_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 8:30 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"8:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/adiavictoria"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/adiavictoria\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1HKGjRPwI0gaFyv4aSWPPl"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adiavictoria"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/adiavictoria.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCwXoqCy4Gf15M2j3wz4_uzQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/09\/2019 01:51:47 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"laura-ernst-juggler--acrobat":{"id":"4952","name":"Laura Ernst, Juggler & Acrobat","friendly_url":"laura-ernst-juggler--acrobat","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","dates":"07-04 07-05 07-06","long_dates":"July 4 July 5 July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4 Friday, July 5 Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>When Laura was little, her dad told her that if she picked a career that she truly loved then she would never have to work a day of her life.

Whether singing an early rocker, a soulful ballad, or a hip-swiveling movie tune, he has mastered the Elvis sound so well that it just might give you goose bumps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about authenticity,&rdquo; says Van Thiel. &ldquo;I try to sound as close to the original as possible. People often think I&rsquo;m lip-syncing. For me, that's the ultimate compliment.&rdquo; Fans respond not only to Van Thiel&rsquo;s voice and resemblance to Elvis, but to his sincerity, playful sense of humor, and humble charm as well. With a uniquely personable performance style, Van Thiel engages audiences with witty banter, Presley history, and playful interaction, making each performance as much a reflection of his own personality as a reverent tribute to Elvis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Van Thiel&rsquo;s passion for singing like the &ldquo;King&rdquo; was sparked at an early age by watching Elvis&rsquo; movies on television. His career as an entertainer began after winning a top slot in a national competition his first time out. For the past 14 years, he has been entertaining regularly at public and private events of all sizes throughout Wisconsin and northern Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He has performed at such venues as Milwaukee&rsquo;s famed Pabst Theater, Summerfest, the Menominee and Ho-Chunk casinos, the Woodstock (Illinois) Opera House, the Grand Opera House in Oshkosh, the Weill Center in Sheboygan, the Door County Auditorium, and other top theaters throughout the state. He has been a featured attraction for numerous groups, including The Doo Wop Daddies, Chuck Travis and The Doo Wa Was, The Oldies But Goodies Spectacular, Mark Shurilla and The Greatest Hits, and most recently The Legendaires Show Band.

We teach beginner through advanced levels, from people who have never had wheels on their feet to those who are ready for choreographed routines. Not only will this workout give you fierce abs, glutes and legs, it will bring a JOY to your life like nothing else. Roller dance is an art form, an expression of individuality as unique as each skater, but at the same time it is a unifying force among the many different people who all have one thing in common &ndash; a pure love for skating. Anywhere you go in this country, or the world, you will find &ldquo;skate family&rdquo; who welcome you to their wood, concrete, or cement to enjoy a session of unapologetic bliss with strangers who you suddenly feel know you better than your actual family. That&rsquo;s because you are united with others who feel the same sense of freedom and release every time a groove starts their wheels turning. The exercise is real, and the skate love is pure magic! Roller dance didn&rsquo;t die with disco, its alive and well and we want you to experience it, all while getting in fantastic shape. Whether you are a derby girl or someone who has never had wheels on their feet, this can be your happy place. It&rsquo;s a great workout, a way to forget about anything that&rsquo;s bothering you for an hour or more, a place to be with like-minded joy-seekers, a way to let music fill up your soul and make your wheels flow, a way to express yourself creatively even if you don&rsquo;t think you have a creative bone in your body. We promise, you do. You might have just needed 8 wheels to feel it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"font_7\"><span class=\"color_11\">We teach proper form\/posture, balance, weight shifting, and basic moves, then move on to transitions, combinations and routines all while jamming to great, soulful, inspiring music. No skates? No problem. We have rentals, just tell us your size and we&rsquo;ll get you set to go for class! Our hope is to keep classes together so you can roll with your sk8 family weekly and eventually add in your own routines! No one is left behind as we will build our levels and repeat classes around our students for maximum learning and experience. We can promise fun, a great workout, and some truly happy moments.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"font_7\"><span class=\"color_11\">Roller skating will make you physically stronger than you ever imagined but more than that, you&rsquo;ll feel this roll in your soul &hellip;you may never NOT want wheels on your feet again.

We are a&nbsp;<strong>\"family friendly\"<\/strong>&nbsp;promotion that strives to be the&nbsp;<strong>best<\/strong>&nbsp;in wrestling entertainment with past, present and future stars from USA, WWE, TNA and GLOBAL.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2004, wrestler\/promoter Frankie DeFalco based his promotion with an \"Old School\" tradition. Watching professional wrestling since the age of 5, watching AWA legends like the Crusher, Dick the Bruiser, Mad Dog Vachon, Verne Gagne, Wahoo McDaniels, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham and his idol, the \"American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes.<\/p>\n<p>As time went on, Frankie learned to appreciate the history and tradition of the \"Old School\" way. So in May of 1979, Frankie was trained by Al \"King Kong\" Patterson and had his 1st match on May 8, 1979. In 1980, inside the storied Milwaukee Auditorium, Frankie wrestled in a tag team match with Jeff May against the Slaughterhouse Brothers. They won that match in front of 3,000 screaming fans to capture the UWA Tag Team Championship.<\/p>\n<p>After several years with Patterson, he went on to wrestle for Tom \"Rocky\" Stone's IAW promotion. He held several titles including as a 5 time Tag Team Champion and 3 time Heavyweight Champion.<\/p>\n<p>At that time, Stone was involved in getting talent for AWA and WWF. Frankie wrestled there on and off for for both companies for nearly 10 years, being on TV &amp; wrestling on house shows throughout the country. He got to know and competed against many wrestlers including Curt Henning, Scott Hall, The Road Warriors, Hulk Hogan, Larry Zbyszko, Nick Bockwinkle, Shawn Michaels, Marty Jannetty, The Big Boss Man, The Honky Tonk Man, Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, Ted DiBiase, Andre The Giant and a host of others.<\/p>\n<p>Carrying over that tradition, Frankie started up Brew City Wrestling in January 2004. Matt Winchester, ROH star Steve Corino, Chase McCoy, Dysfunction, and Psychotic Rage just to name a few, are the heart and soul of every Brew City Wrestling show. When you attend a Brew City Wrestling show, you will not be disappointed with the \"Old School\" tradition. Many superstar Legends have wrestled in BCW like Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, WWE star Kevin Owens, Tito Santana, Larry Zbyszko, Greg Gagne and The Honkly Tonk Man.<\/p>\n<p>The wrestlers are always willing to give a high five, an autograph, take a picture and most importantly, spend time with the fans.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BrewCityWrestling_11_33_35_AM_3_14_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 2 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 2","start_time":"6:00 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 3 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 3","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrewCityWrestling1"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BCWFANDMONIUM"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.brewcitywrestling1.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLDoCQOaeNIsvJbzvhxjh7tFM3WLy-BHhn"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/01\/2019 03:02:57 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"paul-cebar-tomorrow-sound":{"id":"5070","name":"Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound","friendly_url":"paul-cebar-tomorrow-sound","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound are the latest in Fresh Venerable. Benefitting from years of unassuming and understated hipness, they bring forth a funky, lyrically charged racket that sits comfortably with soulful sounds the world over.<\/p>\n<p>Intricate but free-swinging, explosive yet intimate, fresh and green as grass.<\/p>\n<p>Taking cues from the dance bands of western Louisiana (and his native Midwest,), the streets (and 45&rsquo;s) of New Orleans, touring African and Caribbean combos and the soul, funk &amp; blues of his youth coupled with early , teeth-cutting experience in the verbal hotbeds of &nbsp;the coffeehouse scene, Cebar is a masterful synthesist of rhythmic culture<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow Sound are an elite crew of offhand adepts who bring plenty of their own wood to the fire. Drummer Reggie Bordeaux, casts his nets with a mystifying subtlety bringing his own fleet-footed refinement and grease. Multi-instrumentalist Bob Jennings, lends his bandleader the luxury of implying a much larger ensemble with his multi-hued contributions on keys and reeds. Bassist Mike Fredrickson (a distinguished singer-songwriter in his own right) anchors and prods with the best of them.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Cebar cut his teeth musically in the coffeehouse folk scene of the mid-&rsquo;70s in Milwaukee. First paying gigs took place in late &rsquo;76 with an emphasis on solo recasting of small combo jump-blues and other early R&amp;B. Upon graduation from New College in Sarasota, Florida, with a thesis addressing rhythm &amp; blues varieties featuring a hearty emphasis on Louis Jordan and Buddy Johnson, Cebar dedicated himself to trodding the boards in earnest and spent substantial amounts of time testing the waters out New York way while exploring band dynamics with a soul and New Orleans-minded crew called the R&amp;B Cadets back home. The Cadets ranged about from 1980 to 1986 and featured the grand original tunes of John Sieger alongside the winning assortment of B sides and obscurities that were the fruits of Cebar&rsquo;s research. Concurrently, he kept alive the spark of his solo work with a small group which came to be known as The Milwaukeeans. Throughout the early 80s, this combo featured Rip Tenor on tenor sax, Alan Anderson on upright bass, Robyn Pluer on vocals and Paul on acoustic guitar and vocals, and drew most of its repertoire from &rsquo;30s, &rsquo;40s and &rsquo;50s jazz and R&amp;B.<\/p>\n<p>With the demise of the Cadets in mid-1986, Cebar and Pluer, Tenor and Anderson welcomed drummer Randy Baugher and early Cadet saxophonist\/vocalist Juli Wood to a new dance-floor fortified version of The Milwaukeeans which reflected Paul&rsquo;s ongoing and deepening fascination with African, Latin American and Caribbean rhythm &amp; blues analogues. Rambling about the Midwest for the remainder of the &rsquo;80s with occasional forays east and south, The Milwaukeeans began to rely more and more upon the original material that began to emerge in the aftermath of years of interpolation and grappling with favorites.<\/p>\n<p>The first studio album, &ldquo;That Unhinged Thing,&rdquo; which was culled from a number of years of recording, finally saw the light of day in 1993. It sparked a wider itinerary in the touring department, with initial forays to the west coast and Canada, as well as returns to the east and south. Following the release of the record and six months of touring, founding member and estimable vocalist Robyn Pluer left the band to attend to le private life.<\/p>\n<p>Rebuffing the command of the record label, Shanachie, that he add a female vocalist, Cebar and cohorts ventured forth into the storm without a label umbrella for what turned into two years of enthusiastic touring with much attendant hand-wringing. Finally, they landed on the shores of a little label that could (for awhile), Don&rsquo;t Records, a Milwaukee-based, heart-driven indie. In the summer of &rsquo;95, they set about making &ldquo;Upstroke for the Downfolk,&rdquo; while upon its release in the fall of that year began to make inroads at adult album alternative radio outlets nationwide. The single &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Leave Me No Ladder&rdquo; ushered the fellows to a new level of visibility and the vans rolled on.<\/p>\n<p>A six-song EP, &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Dance For You,&rdquo; followed in the spring of &rsquo;96 and was superseded by &ldquo;The Get-Go,&rdquo; a full-length recording released in the fall of &rsquo;97. Radio support was more sporadic, though the fan corps kept growing. But halfway through &rsquo;98, Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s distributor declared bankruptcy and its inventory was impounded. With its merchandise out of reach, Don&rsquo;t found it increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible to carry on.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, 15 1\/2 years into the dance band incarnation of The Milwaukeeans, the fellows presented, &ldquo;Suchamuch&rdquo;,a long-requested live album recorded at Martyr&rsquo;s in Chicago and continued to offer their multifarious wares to all and sundry. The present day incarnation of Tomorrow Sound took shape with the arrival (8 years back) of bassist, Mike Fredrickson, joining 22 year veterans Reggie Bordeaux on drums and Bob Jennings on saxophones and keyboards.<\/p>\n<p>The peripatetic pageant continues unabated with renewed focus on &ldquo;the song &rdquo; in the context of the increasingly forceful rhythmic exploration that is at the heart of Cebar&rsquo;s quest. Stripping back to 4 pieces has opened up space for the understated command of Bob Jennings&rsquo; keyboard and saxophonic thinking. Field Marshall Cebar&rsquo;s pithy guitar musing comes to the fore building upon the muscular rhythmic lattice laid by Reggie and Mike. With an ever-deepening appreciation for the funk and the polyglot rhythmic conception that is their trademark, Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound said More! More! More! in 2004. Way to thrive in 2005! Dipped their wicks in 2006, Partied like &rsquo;11 in 2007, and have their wild heads on straight in 2008. Fine fine Fine into 2009! funked it again and again and again and again in &rsquo;10, made like 2107 in &rsquo;11, and have packed up the worry they shelved in &rsquo;12, incorporated the added vim they were flirtin&rsquo; with in &rsquo;13 and are full-on sportin&rsquo; A-team in &rsquo;18<\/p>\n<p>Presently spreading the word with their gangling, headlong and insouciant record,&rdquo;FINE RUDE THING&rdquo;, Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound want and need you to come on out and help them get down.<\/p>\n<p>Many musicians have graced the stage with Paul in the course of the aforementioned wander.

In that time they got a lot of folk<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">s out on the dance floor, playing a distinctive mix of of deep soul cuts from Paul Cebar&rsquo;s massive record collection and some sparkling originals, written by John Sieger, often in tandem with Michael Feldman, a friend and now longtime host of Public Radio&rsquo;s Whad&rsquo;ya Know?<br \/><br \/>Splitting lead duties with Sieger and Cebar was the lovely chanteuse, Robin Pluer. Owner of one the lovelier voice heard in the midwest, Ms. Pluer was a dollop of sweetness at the top of the band&rsquo;s deep range. Rounding out the lineup was Mike Sieger, John&rsquo;s brother and vocal doppelganger, who played bass. Original drummer Cy Costabile, was later replaced by Bobby Schneider and the saxophonist Juli Wood was replaced by keyboard\/sax man Bob Jennings.<br \/><br \/>In it&rsquo;s prime, the band had a large following in Milwaukee, where they were pretty much the house band at the late, lamented Century Hall. They travelled well too, with fans in the Twin Cities, Chicago, Madison and even New York where they played legendary clubs like CBGB&rsquo;s, The Knitting Factory and The Lone Star. Their only record, Top Happy, came out in 1986. It featured a song produced by Nick Lowe, a fan who had stumbled across them after playing a show in Milwaukee. The record got great reviews and could have been the start of even bigger things, but like many bands, people were pulling, and being pulled, in different directions.<br \/><br \/>What once was one thing became three, Paul toured and recorded with The Milwaukeeans and Tomorrow Sound, John led Semi-Twang and wrote songs for other artists, and Robin continued to dazzle sing standards in French and English. There was brief reunion in 2000 and now, in 2015 they got back together. Asked to perform at an outdoor event in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, the rehearsals went well and the gig was a smash. Further bookings followed and you can now expect to see the band from time to time and experience the joy of dancing to this seriously great unit.<\/span><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_RBCadets_7_36_43_PM_4_8_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 27 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 27","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RandBCadets\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/23\/2019 10:16:44 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"steve-jennings---frisbee-exhibition":{"id":"5099","name":"Steve Jennings - Frisbee Exhibition","friendly_url":"steve-jennings---frisbee-exhibition","stages":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","dates":"07-04 07-05","long_dates":"July 4 July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4 Friday, July 5","description":"<p>STEVE JENNINGS has been entertaining and educating crowds with his Frisbee knowledge and amazing skills for decades.&nbsp;He's been the&nbsp; Wisconsin state Freestyle Frisbee Champion&nbsp;14 times.

It inspires me and it inspires others,&rdquo; declares <strong>Terri Nunn<\/strong>, the charismatic and enigmatic singer of L.A.&rsquo;s iconic synth electro-pop pioneers, <strong>BERLIN<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BERLIN<\/strong> will forever be recognized as the American progenitor of electro-pop artistry with sensually appealing lyrics. Few bands emerging from the era of <strong>BERLIN<\/strong> have achieved as far-reaching and long-lasting an impact and, rarely, such a timeless array of musical grooves. The Los Angeles-based band made its first national impression with the provocative single \"Sex (I'm A...)\" from the platinum-selling debut EP <em>Pleasure Victim<\/em> in 1982. &ldquo;The Metro&rdquo; and &ldquo;No More Words&rdquo; were also chart toppers, but it was the unforgettable, intimate, and strikingly beautiful love song, &ldquo;Take My Breath Away&rdquo; that took the band to another level. The ballad&rsquo;s defining role in the Tom Cruise film, <em>Top Gun<\/em>, helped solidify <strong>BERLIN&rsquo;s <\/strong>everlasting place in American pop-culture. The song was a #1 international hit and received both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for &ldquo;Best Original Song&rdquo; in 1986.<\/p>\n<p>The band released its seventh studio album, <em>Animal<\/em>, in 2013. <em>Animal<\/em> explored contemporary electronic dance music while remaining true to the groundbreaking sound and <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s <\/strong>signature vocals that continue to define <strong>BERLIN<\/strong>. <em>Animal<\/em> was the result of <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s<\/strong> re-ignited love affair with current electronic music, and the feeling that <strong>BERLIN<\/strong> could make a unique statement in the EDM [electronic dance music] milieu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still my favorite medium. I&rsquo;ve loved it since I met John [Crawford, original Berlin bassist) in 1979, when he wanted to bring electronic music to America, because it wasn&rsquo;t here yet,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;What it&rsquo;s morphing into is exciting me so much, I was motivated to look for songwriting partners to help us initial impression on the music world in 1982, with their seductive single, &ldquo;Sex (I&rsquo;m A&hellip;),&rdquo; from the platinum- certified debut EP <em>Pleasure Victim<\/em>. <strong>BERLIN&rsquo;s<\/strong> first full length LP, <em>Love Life,<\/em> hit in 1984 and was certified gold. In 1986, <strong>BERLIN<\/strong> topped the charts with the unforgettable, intimate and strikingly beautiful love song, &ldquo;Take My Breath Away.&rdquo; The ballad&rsquo;s defining role in the Tom Cruise film <em>Top Gun<\/em> has also helped solidify <strong>BERLIN&rsquo;s <\/strong>everlasting place in American pop-culture. <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s<\/strong> ongoing influence earned her the #11 spot on VH1.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Greatest Women in Rock,&rdquo; while, as an actress, she played leading roles in films including <em>Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold <\/em>with Kim Basinger, and <em>Thank God It&rsquo;s Friday<\/em> with Jeff Goldblum and Debra Winger.<\/p>\n<p>Currently,<strong> Nunn <\/strong>is recording a brand new <strong>BERLIN<\/strong>&nbsp;studio album with her original <strong>BERLIN <\/strong>band members and co-writers, John Crawford (bass) and David Diamond (keyboards).&nbsp; The album is scheduled for release in mid 2019. The album is being produced by Australian producers Andy and Thom Mak. The album marks the first collaboration by <strong>Nunn,<\/strong> Crawford and Diamond since <em>Love <\/em>Life, the third BERLIN album, released in 1984.<\/p>\n<p>Video was very important to early hits like \"Sex (I'm A...)\" and \"The Metro\"&mdash; has also taken on new meaning for <strong>BERLIN<\/strong>. &ldquo;YouTube is the new MTV,&rdquo; <strong>Nunn <\/strong>notes. &ldquo;We used to spend so much money on mini movies, but now all you need is a good HD camera and a guy who knows some lighting. Online is where people go to see and hear music&mdash;it&rsquo;s free and it&rsquo;s easy and so wonderful.&rdquo; <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s<\/strong> honesty and infectious enthusiasm carries through every aspect of <em>Animal<\/em>, which she views as an entirely new chapter. &ldquo;I always looked at music as passion. All we can do is appreciate that people&rsquo;s passion is so strong for music... I feel it too, it&rsquo;s part of my DNA, and I love what I grew up with. What I learn as I get older,&rdquo; she concludes, &ldquo;is that it&rsquo;s not about money or &lsquo;making it.&rsquo; Sure, they&rsquo;re fun games, but it&rsquo;s about connection, that&rsquo;s where the real joy, passion and bliss comes from, and music is such a huge part of connecting people. It&rsquo;s the way&hellip; to bliss.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>BERLIN&rsquo;s<\/strong> discography has yielded twelve gold and platinum album awards. The band&mdash;founded by <strong>Nunn<\/strong>, bassist John Crawford, and keyboard player David Diamond&mdash;made its everlasting place in American pop-culture. <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s<\/strong> ongoing influence earned her the #11 spot on VH1.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Greatest Women in Rock,&rdquo; while, as an actress, she played leading roles in films including <em>Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold <\/em>with Kim Basinger, and <em>Thank God It&rsquo;s Friday<\/em> with Jeff Goldblum and Debra Winger. Along with comedienne, Wendy Liebman, <strong>Nunn<\/strong> also previously hosted the critically acclaimed radio show <em>Unbound with <strong>Terri Nunn<\/strong><\/em> on 88.5 FM KCSN Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>Despite her many creative outlets, music, <strong>BERLIN<\/strong> and touring remain <strong>Nunn&rsquo;s<\/strong> first love. <strong>Nunn,<\/strong> a rabid music fan, was inspired by Fleetwood Mac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhiannon&rdquo; and her discovery of the LA club scene, starting with the band, X. Looking back, she recalls her own early musical dreams. &ldquo;I remember going to a Rolling Stones concert at the Rose Bowl, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe they did 2 &frac12; hours of songs and I knew every single one! That&rsquo;s a legacy, a body of work that has mattered to people. That&rsquo;s what I aspired to,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Of course, no way am I close to that body of work, but I have a number of songs that people love that much, and they come to hear Berlin over and over. I&rsquo;m so grateful for that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BerlinFeat.TerriNunn_1_50_12_PM_4_5_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 5 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 5","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/berlinofficialband"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.berlinpage.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RealTerriNunn"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KTldBSvnhlY&feature=youtu.be"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2aS6jYh7ysTL1ZUsHneNgM"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/24\/2019 09:48:47 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"milwaukee-admirals-hockey":{"id":"5139","name":"Milwaukee Admirals Hockey","friendly_url":"milwaukee-admirals-hockey","stages":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","dates":"06-26 06-27 06-28 07-02 07-03 07-05","long_dates":"June 26 June 27 June 28 July 2 July 3 July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26 Thursday, June 27 Friday, June 28 Tuesday, July 2 Wednesday, July 3 Friday, July 5","description":"<p><p>Milwaukee's very own AHL Hockey team.<\/p><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MilwaukeeAdmiralsHockey_11_14_10_AM_4_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"June 26 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"June 26","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"June 27 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"June 27","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"June 28 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"June 28","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 2 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 2","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 3 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 3","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 5 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 5","start_time":"4:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mkeadmirals"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.milwaukeeadmirals.com\/home.html"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mkeadmirals"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rpylkJ6xYAw"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mkeadmirals\/?hl=en"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/06\/2019 02:02:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"tegan-marie":{"id":"5145","name":"Tegan Marie","friendly_url":"tegan-marie","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>With a larger-than-life voice, Tegan Marie, 15, was discovered by media platform Sweety High and went on to become the youngest female to sign to a major Country label (Warner Music Nashville) in 45 years.

His interest began at about age six when an older brother gave him a toy magic set. His initial &lsquo;public&rsquo; appearance was at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Center Street Public Library in 1960 for which he was paid $7.50. The repertoire included scarves that magically appeared and cards that changed from one value to another.<\/p>\n<p>David now travels far from his Milwaukee, Wisconsin home and causes women to appear or transform into his tiger, Tara. His Wonders of Magic has been presented in over thirty states, coast-to-coast, and is a lavish production with beautiful settings, spectacular illusions, colorful costuming, and evocative music.<\/p>\n<p>David studied theater at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where he graduated with honors and a BFA degree. On campus he created a benefit show that ran for ten years. He also briefly taught a course in magic at UW-M.<\/p>\n<p>In 1979 an original musical was written around David called It Must Be Magic. Staged at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Pabst Theatre, it ran for sixty sold-out performances. He is very well known in his home city where he regularly performs for many private functions and at popular public events such as Rainbow Summer, Holiday Folk Fair, County Stadium and State Fair Park doings, and -since 1980- annual twice nightly appearances at Summerfest, the world&rsquo;s largest music festival.<\/p>\n<p>Frequently called upon by major corporations, David has created specialized magical performances for Ford, Oldsmobile, Buick, McDonald&rsquo;s, IBM, General Electric, Sony, Miller Brewing, Mercury Marine, and Walgreen&rsquo;s. In November 1999, he traveled to Antwerp, Belgium to perform for the international sales force of Philips Medical. One year later, in 2000, John Deere invited him to host their new product rollout and host six presentations to their dealers over a three-week period in Florida. &nbsp; In December, 2013 David was invited by Armed Forces Entertainment to fly around the world in eleven days and present shows for our troops overseas. &nbsp;Five appearances were made in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>He combined his love of classical music with magic to create The Maestro &amp; The Magician, a concert attraction that has appeared with notable orchestras in California, Hawaii, Arizona, and Texas as well as with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Syracuse Symphony, and Rochester Orchestra.In the 21st century David has become a frequent guest artist with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.<\/p>\n<p>David&rsquo;s holiday attraction, Merry Magic Christmas, has appeared in New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Hawaii. Seasonal music and magic are blended for this family attraction.<\/p>\n<p>In 1991 David and his staff created Illusions in the Night, perhaps the only elaborate magic and illusion show designed to scare an audience. It has appeared annually in Milwaukee. The show -and its ghosts-has also traveled to upstate Wisconsin and Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>Within his field David Seebach has won honors and high acclaim. He has been a featured performer at the national convention of the Society of American Magicians, the east coast Magic Jubilee, and the annual Magic Get-Together where he has been featured frequently and won the coveted &lsquo;Best of the Best&rsquo; trophy. He has also appeared at Hollywood&rsquo;s famed Magic Castle, long considered a crown jewel in magicdom. His writing was featured monthly in a long-published conjuror&rsquo;s magazine.<\/p>\n<p>He still makes his home in the Milwaukee area when not out on-the-road performing elsewhere.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DavidSeebachsWondersofMagic_12_28_04_AM_4_6_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"6:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 8:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"8:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"5:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"5:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DavidSeebachMagic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.davidseebach.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/16\/2019 03:09:06 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"elation-dance-center":{"id":"5181","name":"Elation Dance Center","friendly_url":"elation-dance-center","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","dates":"06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>Elation Dance Company encompasses what we call the three C's &nbsp;- Concert, Competition &amp; Community, which allows our dancers to enjoy and share all aspect of the art of dance.

His beginnings were in 1980 when he formed part of Marvin Cardona's 'Conjunto Kaney' as lead vocalist.<\/p>\n<p>In 1981 he was lead vocalist for 'Orquesta Arallues' with whom he recorded a single. In 1982 he sang with 'Orquesta Pueblo Latino'. In mid 1982 he started his first ban which he named 'Lester Orengo y su Orquesta'. In 1983 he was persuaded by Erick Figueroa and Eddie Guagua Rivera to become lead vocalist for 'Conjunto Erigua'. He recorded a signle with 'Conjunto Erigua' titlied 'Dimelo Tu:' which wa played favorably in radio stations throughout the island of Puerto Rico during the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>it was Eddie Guagua who convinced him to change he name to a more commercial one, the result, 'VAN LESTER'. In mid 1984, VAN LESTER and Israel 'Ishpacor' Pagan formed a band which they named 'El Sonido De La Bestia' (the soung of the beast). It was with this band that VAN LESTER initiates his talent as an arranger and producer when he decides to record a single titled 'Escondete' with his band. In 1985 he saw his dream come ture when he recorded with 'La Croporacion Latina'; this recording launched his recording career.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn't until 1989 that his recording career took off professionally when he recorded two compact discs titled 'Puerto Rico 2013' and 'Banda'lla' along side 'FRANK FERRER and PUERTO RICO 2013'. VAN LESTER gained popularity with the Puerto Rican public with the two hit singles of these productions. 'Hermano Hector' and 'Mi Mama No Quiere' The similarity between VAN LESTER and HECTOR LAVOE captured the attention of producer RALPH MERCADO. He immediately signed a recording contract with FRANK FERRER for RMM Record under the label 'SONERO' to record VAN LESTER. This recording contract makes VAN LESTER part of the permanent 'Stellar Salsa Scene' and helps launch his international singing career with his first CD titled 'Soy La Voz'.<\/p>\n<p>VAN LESTER has toured the United States, Central and South America and Europe. In 1993, he had the privilege of visiting Anchorage, Alaska to introduce 'Salsa' to the region.

The band&rsquo;s travel circuit around the Midwest continues to grow along with their reputation for being a highly respected and professional level group. National programs such as Good Morning Ireland, Blarney on the Air, and Paddyrock internet radio have featured Reilly and Celtic Radio Music Network rates them as five out of five stars. Their ability to adapt Celtic music to an American rock audience, and include unexpected rock favorites into their set, makes them the perfect eclectic choice in today&rsquo;s watered down and predictable Celtic scene.<\/p>\n<p>Reilly&rsquo;s latest release, Revelry and Regret, is their strongest effort to date and showcases their vibrant tongue-in-cheek humor along with musical chops and four-part vocal harmonies. Original tunes, and their lyrics, serve as a sort of confessional&mdash;perfect for an Irish band. See &ldquo;Fireflies&rdquo; and &ldquo;One Can Never Be Overly Prepared&rdquo; for these episodes. Traditionals, such as &ldquo;Paddy Works on the Railway&rdquo;, are given a new coat of rollicking musical paint. Though lyrically wistful at times, the band wastes no time to make a live show truly pop with energy.<\/p>\n<p>Reilly&rsquo;s partnership with national label Oglio Entertainment features a holiday record: A Kick Ass Celtic Christmas. This collection of irreverent originals, classic favorites, and traditional tunes features the Reilly penned &ldquo;Dear Santa (I Can Explain)&rdquo; which was selected for both the Daybreak Entertainment and Fine Gold Productions compilations and is in rotation for seasonal nationally syndicated morning show air play. USA Today rated the recording as one of the most stellar and original holiday releases they have ever reviewed.<\/p>\n<p>Being a strong part of the Irish and non-Irish musical community throughout the Midwest, Reilly have appeared regularly at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Irish Fest, The Irish Cultural and Heritage Center in Milwaukee, Manhattan, IL Irish Fest, Will County, IL Celtic Fest, Bastille Days in Milwaukee, City of Indianapolis events, Harley-Davidson festivals, River Rhythms in Milwaukee, countless St. Patrick&rsquo;s parades and activities, Bradley Center events, and at far too many Irish pubs and non-Irish locales around the Midwest to mention. They&rsquo;ve shared the stage with Gaelic Storm, Flogging Molly, Enter the Haggis, The Prodigals, Barra MacNeils, Seven Nations, The Bridies, Luka Bloom and more. Members of Reilly are also involved with community and social outfits such as the Wisconsin Area Music Industry and the Shamrock Club of Wisconsin&mdash;Milwaukee Chapter.<\/p>\n<p>Reilly celebrates Celtic musical heritage and their own American upbringings in both the live setting and on record. They provide a lively musical feast for those who enjoy a bit of nostalgia, a dose of modernism, and a full pint of fun and good will.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Reilly_5_07_59_PM_4_29_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Klement's Sausage & Beer Garden Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"klements-sausage--beer-garden-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/reillyrocks"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.reillyrocks.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/01\/2019 05:23:23 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-squeezettes":{"id":"5293","name":"The Squeezettes","friendly_url":"the-squeezettes","stages":"klements-sausage--beer-garden-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">The four-time WAMI (Wisconsin Area Music Industry) award-winning SQUEEZETTES have been cited as one the state&rsquo;s most unique attractions.

We&rsquo;d watch those videos over and over for months. I loved Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. They looked like my G.I. Joes&mdash;Springsteen was positively ripped, and they were all wearing bandanas, playing in front of these huge American flags. They looked like action heroes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Back then, Leahey was living in Richmond, Va., where his mom sold Mary Kay cosmetics door to door. Every day after school, he rode shotgun in her station wagon, the floorboards littered with the latest lipstick shades, the radio soundtracking their rounds. The music was always Top 40, most often the pop rock of the late &rsquo;80s: the big guitars, big drums and even bigger hooks of artists like Springsteen, Tom Petty, John Mellencamp and Bob Seger. These larger-than-life stars at the peak of their popularity, playing massive stadium shows to throngs of adoring fans, their videos in heavy rotation on MTV and their platinum records flying off the shelves&mdash;it was rock &amp; roll unfolding on the grandest of scales. Their music became Leahey&rsquo;s bedrock and, all these years later, the guiding force behind <em>Airwaves<\/em>, which shepherds the sounds of this golden era into the present day.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to being an acclaimed solo artist featured at <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>, <em>Billboard<\/em> and <em>American Songwriter<\/em>, the Nashville-based Leahey is also a sought-after guitarist who regularly tours with Elizabeth Cook, and has backed Rodney Crowell, Drew Holcomb, Will Hoge and more. For <em>Airwaves <\/em>(out March 1)<em>,<\/em> Leahey tapped multi-platinum producer Paul Ebersold, who enlisted Steelism&rsquo;s Jon Estes and Jon Radford on bass and drums, respectively. Leahey also brought in his childhood best friend Phil Heesen III to add harmony vocals and guitar, as well as his buddy Sadler Vaden, who took a break from touring with Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit long enough to drop by the studio and lay down some guitar leads on &ldquo;Start the Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Came Here to Run&rdquo; and &ldquo;Workin Ain&rsquo;t Workin.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Airwaves<\/em> is timeless American rock &amp; roll that rings from sea to shining sea, a candy-apple-red Mustang convertible of a record burning up the interstate with the ragtop down. With it, Leahey refines the jangly Americana of his 2016 Ken Coomer-produced debut, <em>Skyline in Central Time<\/em>, grasping for the still-smoldering torch of Petty and Springsteen, angling confidently to assume the mantle of their unpretentious everyman sound.&nbsp; Unadorned but poignant lyrics carried by simple, uplifting melodies. Distorted windmill guitar strums. Triumphant swells of organ cresting like whitecap foam on the ceaseless ocean. Driving bass lines locked tight with the kick, pumping in unison like the pistons of an engine straight off a 1980s Detroit assembly line. Would-be stadium anthems loping forward, the echoing crack of the snare faithfully charting miles per song. In an era hellbent on declaring the genre doornail dead, <em>Airwaves<\/em> is the kind of record that could only be made by a true believer in the power of rock &amp; roll.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Early on, I shared the first mixes of the record with some industry friends,&rdquo; Leahey says. &ldquo;They were like, &lsquo;This sounds cool, but rock &amp; roll isn&rsquo;t really popular right now. Are you sure you want to do this?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Of course! That&rsquo;s what these tunes are. And what do you mean it&rsquo;s not popular? Rock &amp; roll has been around longer than any of us.&rsquo; I have a very clear idea of what my musical strengths are, what I&rsquo;m meant to do, and I have no interest in diluting that or sanding away the rough edges that make it unique and specific to me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Leahey&rsquo;s uncompromising attitude and renewed passion for his music have a whole lot to do with his staring down the prospect of an untimely death&mdash;or possibly the loss of his hearing&mdash;earlier this decade. Requiring brain surgery to remove a life-threatening tumor from his hearing nerve, the odds of the latter were an anxiety-inducing 50 percent. &ldquo;Driving to the hospital with my wife the morning of the operation, I put on Lightning 100 in Nashville. Petty's 'A Face in the Crowd' was on the radio, and it hit me hard&mdash;the production was so enveloping, and I was really cognizant of the different instruments coming from the left and right speakers. It was a gorgeous, lush, layered sound. I wanted so badly to be able to wake up after the operation and still hear music with the same appreciation I had in that moment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully for Leahey, the procedure was a success, his hearing was unfazed and, after a long recovery, he remains cancer free. The experience redefined what playing music meant to him. &ldquo;I nearly lost my ability to make, hear and appreciate music, and that inevitably changes you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;As I got healthier, I was drawn to writing songs that celebrated life. Songs that sounded as huge and immediate as the songs I heard on the radio as a boy in 1989&mdash;which is why we called the new album <em>Airwaves<\/em>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>One of the record&rsquo;s key tracks was actually hatched while Leahey was getting an MRI. &ldquo;The sound of the magnets in the machine &mdash; it was almost like club music, like techno,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I remember being in there, and this percussive sound kept echoing around my body. To me, it sounded like a four-on-the-floor kick drum, and I started humming a melody to it. That became &lsquo;Make It Last.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Once strong enough to return to the road, Leahey played 180 shows in 2016 in support of <em>Skyline in Central Time.<\/em> During that period, &ldquo;Make It Last&rdquo; was a staple in the band&rsquo;s sets. &ldquo;Playing that song live, with those huge, ringing chords&mdash;it felt so good on stage. We were working with an Americana label at the time, but all the slower, sadder songs I'd written no longer felt like me.

As with Petty and The Boss, a lot of Leahey&rsquo;s songs get at the essence of young adulthood spent on the run, and just about every last one could be a set closer or an encore. &ldquo;This record is rooted in the sound of a band playing live,&rdquo; Leahey says. &ldquo;Everything was written on tour, with last night's show still ringing in my ears, and a lot of it was road-tested. To me, this kind of rock &amp; roll never left. It's always on my stereo. It's always in the air.

With over 2,500 shows under their belt, three completed albums and festival appearances at Peach Music Festival, Firefly Music Festival and Kaaboo Del Mar, Hannah Wicklund &amp; The Steppin Stones are on their way to becoming Rock &amp; Roll&rsquo;s next marquee act.<\/p>\n<p>Formed in 2006, by a then eight year old Wicklund, the band has come along way from playing Janis Joplin and Neil Young covers. Between then and now, Hannah Wicklund &amp; The Steppin Stones have been billed alongside legacy acts such as Jefferson Starship, Kansas and The Marshall Tucker Band. Fast forward to now, one year after the 2018 release of their 10 track self titled album, Hannah Wicklund &amp; The Steppin Stones has amassed over 2.5mm streams on their most recent project and have been billed alongside current and legendary chart topping mainstays such as X Ambassadors, Cage the Elephant, Tom Petty, Alanis Morissette and Muse.<\/p>\n<p>Although Hannah&rsquo;s roaring guitar riffs on her custom Tom Anderson guitar and orange amp set the tone for The Steppin Stones performances, it&rsquo;s her vocal range and well-beyond-her-years songwriting that have led to the success of their latest release, helping to propel them to a regular mainstay festival act. Hannah&rsquo;s musical vision stays close to her classic rock roots, but in no way is a classic rock tribute. Their music is a refreshing focus on raw and organic emotions in a time of digitally driven recordings and performances.<\/p>\n<p>2019 is poised to be a momentous year for the blossoming power trio on the road and in the studio. Hannah Wicklund &amp; The Steppin Stones are supporting the Stone Temple Pilots, joining Peter Frampton and Joe Bonamassa on a Mediterranean cruise and bringing the heat at Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta, GA to kick off their summer headline tour across the United States. Throughout the year, Hannah will be working on intimate, authentic and stripped down tracks about embracing and learning from the darker sides of life in addition to a new full band record. Hannah Wicklund &amp; The Steppin Stones will leave their fans feeling inspired and connected in a way they haven&rsquo;t felt in a long time.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_HannahWicklundTheSteppinStones_3_31_54_PM_4_11_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"5:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hannahwicklundss\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hannahwicklund\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4HANAeqPfEO5gZhM04fKXF"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/steppinstonessc"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.hannahwicklund.com\/welcome"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EfMlZoRWwgc"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/25\/2019 09:23:37 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"southwest-ymca":{"id":"5318","name":"Southwest YMCA","friendly_url":"southwest-ymca","stages":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","dates":"06-28 06-29 07-03 07-04","long_dates":"June 28 June 29 July 3 July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28 Saturday, June 29 Wednesday, July 3 Thursday, July 4","description":"<p><p>The Y is an inclusive organization of men, women and children joined together by a shared commitment to nurturing the potential of kids, promoting healthy living and fostering a sense of social responsibility.<\/p><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SouthwestYMCA_11_25_15_AM_4_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"June 28 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"June 28","start_time":"3:00 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"June 29 - 4:30 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"June 29","start_time":"4:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 3 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 3","start_time":"3:00 PM"},{"stage_name":"Gruber Law Offices Sportszone","date_time":"July 4 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"gruber-law-offices-sportszone","date":"July 4","start_time":"3:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"twitter","link":""},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.gwcymca.org"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/31\/2019 11:15:54 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"amy-lowe--king-katz":{"id":"5323","name":"Amy Lowe & King Katz","friendly_url":"amy-lowe--king-katz","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","dates":"07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>AMY LOWE &ndash;Guitar- Vocals<\/p>\n<p>Multi-award winning singer &ndash; songwriter, Amy Lowe has captivated audiences from concert halls, schools and libraries to festivals internationally.

The LP features 11 brand new TSB tracks, and is slated for release on Friday, April 1st via Double 180 Gram Vinyl, Compact Disc and Digital Download. The album was recorded last winter at Crushtone Studios, in the shadows of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland, Ohio. Shake Your Faith was produced by the band along with seasoned rock studio veteran Jim Wirt, who has also worked with the likes of Fiona Apple, Incubus and the Buffalo Killers. As with most TSB albums, the sound and songwriting on Shake Your Faith has grown and expanded, yet retained the true nature of the band. It&rsquo;s the first TSB studio record in over 4 years and the first to include &ldquo;new&rdquo; guitarist Eric Saylors.<\/p>\n<p>With the additional band member, the songwriting approach for this record was different than it was on past TSB albums, when they were a 3-piece. Singer\/Guitarist Jeff Massey comments on the TSB songwriting process&hellip;&ldquo;Each song was different. I had a few totally finished songs, or Tod would bring a complete piece of music that would need melody &amp; lyrics. And there were also a bunch of other musical ideas coming from both Eric &amp; Joe, which we would all hash out together.&rdquo; Drummer Joe winters states &ldquo;Everyone really brought ideas to the table, collaboratively, more so with Shake Your Faith, than with any other of our records. That really created a special vibe around the songs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The arctic Lake Erie air made for a secluded and quick session, as it was all recorded and mixed within 12 days. &ldquo;What better circumstances to record in?&rdquo; says Eric Saylors, &ldquo;There weren&rsquo;t any outside distractions!&rdquo; The band entered the studio with a group of songs, but with very loose arrangements. Bassist Tod Bowers elaborates, &ldquo;It really allowed everyone in the band to be inspired by the moment. Sonically inspired by what sounds you were hearing coming out of the speakers&hellip; what was happening in the room, musically between the 4 of us. And you can hear that in the recording.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Shake Your Faith has a wide range of sounds from straight ahead rock n roll to a psychedelic samba, and lyrical direction that extends from love to murder. This album is the true meaning of just that. An album &ndash; a collective piece of music that&rsquo;s meant to be heard front to back. Saylors adds &ldquo;The way the whole record flows, it&rsquo;s like one long song&hellip; takes you on a little journey.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Formed in Chicago back in 1998, The Steepwater Band&rsquo;s signature sound is a nod to early British blues, combined with a modern, raw and gutsy musical approach. Founding members Massey, Bowers and Winters have a synergy that comes from years of playing together. Then in early 2012, the long-time trio was joined by Saylors, from Indianapolis, IN, who brought an added depth to the TSB LIVE sound. Although the band got their start as devotees of delta blues, they have since been expanding on their influences, absorbing everything from Psychedelia to Americana, from Jazz to 50&rsquo;s Rock n&rsquo; Roll Music.<\/p>\n<p>The Steepwater Band has maintained a grueling schedule throughout the last 18 years, averaging about 140 shows per year. They have toured and shared the stage with acts such as Gov&rsquo;t Mule, Buddy Guy, Wilco, Taj Mahal, Marc Ford, ZZ Top, T-Model Ford, North Mississippi All Stars, Leon Russell, Drive-By Truckers, Robert Randolph &amp; the Family Band, Cheap Trick, Bad Company and Heart. In 2005, the band made its European debut, performing at the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. In the following years, the band has returned to the United Kingdom and Europe for multiple club and festival tours, increasing their loyal overseas fan-base.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SteepwaterBandThe_3_17_54_PM_4_16_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 30 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 30","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.steepwater.com\/"},{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thesteepwaterband"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thesteepwaterband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2TgTMg8jrIQjJ3uWkLw93J"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/steepwaterband"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TSBvideo\/featured"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/29\/2019 03:01:45 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chastity-brown":{"id":"5335","name":"Chastity Brown","friendly_url":"chastity-brown","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<div class=\"col sqs-col-6 span-6\">\n<div id=\"block-def6f30ca9b60bba36cc\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based in Minnesota, but with roots in Tennessee, Chastity grew up surrounded by country and soul music. In the full gospel church of her childhood, she played saxophone and drums and found her singing voice and a passion for music. Her first show was in Knoxville, TN, and then it was on to Minneapolis. Since then, she&rsquo;s been featured on NPR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Favorite Sessions,&rdquo; CMT, American Songwriter, the London&nbsp;<em>Times<\/em>, Paste Magazine and others.

Even the title speaks to this push and pull between danger and safety, shadows and shiny lights, and the things we can reach out and touch as opposed to the things we only hear in the distance. &ldquo;What is even happening? One can only guess,&rdquo; Brown sings in the opening track &ldquo;Drive Slow,&rdquo; embracing an uncertainty and sense of wonder from the beginning of the record. By the third track, she&rsquo;s carrying us along with her on a journey inward. Like many masterful songwriters, she has the ability to make her stories feel intensely personal yet open-ended; even in &ldquo;Carried Away,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s hard to tell whether she&rsquo;s singing about a romantic rift, an abusive friendship, or the havoc that anxiety and depression can wreak on an unguarded mind. \" &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me here all alone \/ For so long you&rsquo;ve been my light in the dark,&rdquo; Brown sings on the album&rsquo;s centerpiece, &ldquo;My Stone,&rdquo; while the sexy, Prince-channeling acoustic funk jam &ldquo;Whisper&rdquo; beckons the listener to come closer, to dance with her in the dark, to &ldquo;whisper in my ear all that you need.\"<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about different types of heartbreak, and how one deals with it,&rdquo; Brown says of the album. &ldquo;And not the heartbreak of a coupled relationship; just living life, and the experiences that break your heart. There are these moments on the album where it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;this is intense.' And then hopefully, there are moments where it&rsquo;s alleviated &mdash; as I feel like life is. Life is hard. Every tree, every plant, everything you see in the natural world, just through a growth process, you see how hard it is to grow and bend towards the light.\"<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ChastityBrown_9_44_34_AM_4_24_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChastityBrownMusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chastity_brown\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6vRqjrYlvurWLEwRKvTdEw"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChastityBrown"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/chastitybrownmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hiH9MRrN7dU"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/16\/2019 11:22:44 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"abby-jeanne":{"id":"5336","name":"Abby Jeanne","friendly_url":"abby-jeanne","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p>&nbsp;\"I am just a product of a haunted jukebox and the golden heart degenerates.

With this tool I hope to heal and translate the traumas of our lives.\" - Abby Jeanne<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AbbyJeanne_12_21_07_AM_5_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 28 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 28","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/abbyjeannemusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/abbyjmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5F5sMWK4poPFT3CnzUQley?si=CJ3wko-bQ1arJ10cO_r0fA"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/abbyjeannemusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.abbyjeanne.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s-HkJx3am9Q"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/10\/2019 01:33:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"shandini":{"id":"5340","name":"Shandini","friendly_url":"shandini","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","dates":"06-27 07-03 07-05 07-07","long_dates":"June 27 July 3 July 5 July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27 Wednesday, July 3 Friday, July 5 Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Shandini&rsquo;s magic is top notch!

Having sold over 10 million albums in the US alone, T.I. remains an influential figure in the world of music and entertainment. Universally recognized as a visionary and groundbreaking entrepreneur- one who led the explosion of southern hip hop music and, specifically, trap, to a mainstream breakthrough-T.I. recently announced the release of his eagerly anticipated 10<sup>th<\/sup> studio album and first full-length album in four years, with a new partnership and signing with Epic Records. Marking 15 years since he released his breakthrough album Trap Muzik, (which helped launch the popular hip hop subgenre), Dime Trap is the multi-talented artist&rsquo;s 10<sup>th<\/sup> album and truly brings his career full circle.<\/p>\n<p>An acclaimed innovator with millions of albums sold and more than 35 million singles, T.I. has been awarded 3 Grammy awards, 11 Billboard Awards, 3 BET Awards, 2 American Music Awards and more through the years. Viewed as a seamless collaborator whose prolific musical pairings with seminal superstars include Drake, Beyonce, Pharrell, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Robin Thicke, M.I.A., Lady Gaga, and others, his recently politically-charged collaboration with Kanye West on &ldquo;Ye Vs. The People&rdquo; is also garnering raves. T.I.&rsquo;s decade-and-a-half stewardship of Grand Hustle Records has produced multiple breakout artists, including Iggy Azalea, Travis Scott, and others, and his purpose-driven 2016 EP Us Or Else courageously addressed police brutality and racial inequality in America, hailed by Rolling Stone as another crucial &lsquo;point on the timeline of the rapper&rsquo;s growing social conscious.&rsquo;<\/p>\n<p>T.I.&rsquo;s universal perspective and unwavering perseverance throughout the seismic changes of pop culture has seen him expand his Atlanta based Grand Hustle empire into a diverse conglomerate of brands and entities. His successful forays into music, film, fashion, books, scripted and unscripted television, technology, sports, lifestyle and real estate ventures have garnered him worldwide acclaim as a multi-platform catalyst behind some of the entertainment industry&rsquo;s most compelling endeavors. Most recently, he&rsquo;s locked down deals as an artist\/co-owner of the global stream service TIDAL, and co-creator, producer and star of the new BET reality completion series &ldquo;The Grand Hustle,&rdquo; where T.I. oversees 16 business-minded participants competing for a six-figure salary and the chance to join his coveted empire. Earlier this summer, T.I. reprised his role in the Marvel sequel &ldquo;Antman &amp; the Wasp,&rdquo; which has grossed close to $600 million worldwide at the box office, and co-produced the musical drama &ldquo;Glow Up&rdquo; as part of the PepsiCo&rsquo;s Creators League. He has taken his musical talents to Broadway, having recently received a TONY Award Nomination for &ldquo;Best Original Score (Music and\/or Lyrics) Written for Theater&rdquo; for SpongeBob Square Pants: The Musical.<\/p>\n<p>Also widely recognized for his influence in the community, T.I. has become an activist and dominant force in social issues around race relations, civil and human rights. In response to mass inequality and the murders of unarmed Black citizens, T.I. began his Us or Else movement where he penned a thought-provoking series of op-Eds in the New York Times, Washington Post and Huffington Post, a socially charged album entitled Us or Else: Letter to the System, followed by a provocative short film. Using that as a platform, T.I. launched a formal charitable, social justice and philanthropic arm, Harris Community Works, dedicated to driving systemic change in underserved communities. His most recent philanthropic work includes relief and support efforts for Puerto Rico, Houston, Colin Kaepernick&rsquo;s Million Dollar Challenge and more. Recently, T.I. became a coveted member of the May of Atlanta&rsquo;s Transition Team. T.I. has also recently added Art Curator to his long list of creative credentials. As the official visionary and creator for the first ever pop-up Trap Music Museum, T.I. will lend his visual and artistic wisdom along with his creative energy to chronicle and celebrate the contributions of Trap music. Now, with his Epic Records partnership on course, a new album Dime Trap and a string of creative and business projects, the fearless game-changer is once again taking his always-evolving artistic franchise to new heights.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_T.I._9_49_20_AM_4_24_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TI\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/troubleman31\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT?autoplay=true&v=A"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tip"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.tipaperwork.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCq2QQO2WR5wz2IfLwt3SYfw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/05\/2019 04:12:58 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"milwaukee-community-circus":{"id":"5344","name":"Milwaukee Community Circus","friendly_url":"milwaukee-community-circus","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage kohls-captivation-station","dates":"07-02 06-26 06-27 06-28 06-29 06-30 07-03 07-04 07-05 07-06 07-07","long_dates":"July 2 June 26 June 27 June 28 June 29 June 30 July 3 July 4 July 5 July 6 July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2 Wednesday, June 26 Thursday, June 27 Friday, June 28 Saturday, June 29 Sunday, June 30 Wednesday, July 3 Thursday, July 4 Friday, July 5 Saturday, July 6 Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Milwuakee community circus is a circus talent agency and circus school established in 2012.

Born and raised in the bright and booming metropolis of Toronto, his heart led him out of the city and into Prince Edward County, where country living and a decade of working on farms gave him the time and space to hone his songwriting skills. His music nods to all manner of troubadours who rambled down similar paths throughout history&mdash;he nods slyly to the legendary blues singers who inspired him, offers a soft and insightful touch with his folk songs, and stomps and swaggers through soulful rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. But Jeremie Albino is a natural and an original, created by an alchemy that favours, above all else, that most mysterious and coveted of qualities: heart. And his wildly impressive debut, Hard Time, overflows with it.<\/p>\n<p>The sagas of out-sized characters and the vivid imagery they pass through are given proper treatment by the peaks and valleys of Albino&rsquo;s music, dynamic enough to conjure something light as the sway of flowers in the wind, or the grandeur of an apocalyptic storm. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stories I wrote that came from daydreams,&rdquo; Jeremie explains, &ldquo;about life, love, people, and another time.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hard Time represents a slew of firsts for the young songwriter. Before embarking on the recording, he&rsquo;d never been in a studio, played with a band, or worked with a producer. Jeremie&rsquo;s earthy Americana has never been laid to tape until now. And Hard Time sounds just as untouched by pretension as you&rsquo;d expect from a musician who got to this point simply by letting his heart lead the way. The first recordings were laid down at the Bombshelter in Nashville with producer Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Hurray For The Riff Raff, Langhorne Slim), and the rest was finished off at Union Sound in Toronto with Crispin Day. Get ready for it, coming summer 2019.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JeremieAlbino_1_44_56_PM_4_23_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jeremiealbino"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jeremiealbino\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/69fOAbSc6FEOFmvvMzlNgY?si=dCFC7fiHStyYfdnslDMAaw"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/jeremiealbino.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC4BNy6HDTHyh7orEoH7kT2A"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/24\/2019 01:23:08 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"brett-newski--the-no-tomorrow":{"id":"5355","name":"Brett Newski & the No Tomorrow","friendly_url":"brett-newski--the-no-tomorrow","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p>Known&nbsp;as the&nbsp;first&nbsp;band&nbsp;ever to be kicked out of Wal-Mart for playing an illegal show (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrettNewski\/videos\/10102594768111296\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrettNewski\/videos\/10102594768111296\/<\/a>),&nbsp;<em>Brett Newski&nbsp;&amp; the No Tomorrow&nbsp;<\/em>bring a 90's alternative sound across America this fall.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Newski has played over 1200 shows on every continent except Antarctica.

It's time for a new vice. &bull;newvices&bull; from Milwaukee, WI, plans to be just that, offering an escape from the monotony of daily life and shedding insight on the emotional struggles we all share but don&rsquo;t always show. Truth is, we&rsquo;re all addicted to something. Understanding what causes these addictions and complacencies is one of the many goals &bull;newvices&bull; has set out to conquer. By combining upbeat and energetic pop overtones with a raw and emotional core, &bull;newvices&bull;&rsquo; lyrical and instrumental intricacies find the balance between the joy in life and the crippling feelings that coincide. The band shares the universal human desire to build beautiful memories with their audience, built on lasting foundations, without for a second denying the ever-present reality of suffering in our lives. &bull;newvices&bull; strives to show people that together, through honest discussion and truth, we can overcome the hardships of life. Formed by Rodrick Wortham, &bull;newvices&bull; has undergone direction and member changes, but one thing has always remained constant. The band is here to stay and endlessly willing to adapt in order to continue spreading their message.

Walker Hayes uses the word often. &ldquo;It just felt right,&rdquo; the breakout country singer says of the title for his highly-anticipated new album. It&rsquo;s a celebratory sort of thing, he&rsquo;ll tell you. A new radio station adds his buzzing single, &ldquo;You Broke Up With Me.&rdquo; <em>boom<\/em>. He links up for a national tour with Thomas Rhett. <em>boom<\/em>. That rowdy performance at CMA Fest &ndash;the one that had the crowd singing every word of his music back to him? <em>boom. <\/em>It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Not by a long shot. Lately, though, Hayes has had occasion to bust out the word often. And he&rsquo;s not complaining.<\/p>\n<p>A confessional, no-nonsense singer-songwriter, and one whose voice and perspective brims with relatability, Hayes is a tried-and-true Nashville standout. He&rsquo;s an original in a town all-too-often rife with mimicry and compromise. And, now, he has audiences flocking to him in a major way. Conversational, honest and real in song, Hayes&rsquo; forthcoming debut album is the voice of a grinder laying it bare. It&rsquo;s the stories of a man who realized the songs he couldn&rsquo;t help but write &mdash; about family, struggle, vices and the sacrifices we make for a dream &mdash; were his and his alone. &ldquo;It startles some people. Like, &lsquo;Wow, he&rsquo;s really putting out there,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hayes says of the raw songwriting that characterizes <em>boom<\/em>. and last year&rsquo;s two break-out <em>8 Tracks <\/em>releases. &ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s what my heroes did,&rdquo; he says referencing the Willie&rsquo;s and Waylon&rsquo;s and Merle&rsquo;s of the world. &ldquo;I can only write something if I truly feel it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And if the Mobile, Alabama native has learned anything over more than a decade spent in Nashville, it&rsquo;s that he can <em>only <\/em>be himself. His music &mdash; from the unflinching and honest &ldquo;Beer in the Fridge,&rdquo; to the spare and tender love song &ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; <em>boom.<\/em>&rsquo;s gripping album closer that documents a friend who came to his family&rsquo;s aid in a time of need &mdash; is entirely Hayes&rsquo; own, even if it&rsquo;s not always pretty. Hayes knows only he can sing, or yes, sometimes rap his songs. Nothing thrills him more than having no rules and no restriction on his creativity. &ldquo;As an artist that was so freeing,&rdquo; he says of the flexibility from his label, the recently revamped Monument Records, to be his own man. &ldquo;That was like somebody telling you to write for no other reason than to just write,&rdquo; he says alluding to the freedom to pen attention-getting songs like &ldquo;Shut Up Kenny,&rdquo; his ode to songs like Kenny Chesney&rsquo;s on the radio that can immediately snap you back into <em>those <\/em>memories. &ldquo;No one was saying, &lsquo;Your song has to go on this radio station.&rsquo; They just said, &lsquo;Go, do what you love and love doing it every day.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d long had it drilled into his head that there existed finite rules that comprised a successful country song. So, Hayes is the first to admit it caught him off guard when listeners responded so passionately to the personal music he was writing. The singer says that, in time, he realized simply, &ldquo;people want to hear the nitty gritty of life and the honesty and the authenticity. Just because there is something that typically works on radio right now doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s not listeners out there that are craving that personal experience that they can relate to.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I didn&rsquo;t settle for anything but the one-hundred percent truth in a song,&rdquo; Hayes continues, &ldquo;listeners were intrigued the most.&rdquo; This father of six, who moved to Nashville on a hunch 12 years ago and for years and struggled to make it work, relishes his current moment. He&rsquo;d been dropped from multiple record labels and admits there was a time he wondered how he&rsquo;d feed his growing family. Not until he began peeling back the layers to his own life and subsequently documenting it in song did everything fall into place. &ldquo;A song should move people like a conversation but be prettier and more memorable,&rdquo; Hayes says of his current attitude toward songwriting. &ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s just therapeutic to write.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hayes has always been the type that had to be cajoled into doing what always came natural to him. The son of a real estate broker, Hayes loved music &mdash; piano recitals, noodling on his guitar &mdash; but figured he&rsquo;d stick around home and log a normal 9-5. However, after constant needling from his father, Hayes finally agreed to perform at a local bar, if only to get dad off his back. It was a tiny stage, he remembers with a laugh &mdash; &ldquo;a small crowd, but there was applause after my songs&rdquo; &mdash; and it felt incredible. &ldquo;For some reason, when I left that show that night I knew right then that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do,&rdquo; Hayes recalls. He called his wife, asked her if she wanted to move to Nashville, and she said yes without hesitation.<\/p>\n<p>He instantly fell in love with songwriting, landed a job with a publishing company, and even got a record deal but, things in Nashville aren&rsquo;t as easy as they seem and soon Hayes&rsquo; deals fell through. For years he grinded it out: writing songs for other artists where he could, working odd jobs to pay the bills, lying in bed at night trying to convince himself to not love writing songs anymore &ldquo;because all it does is mess me up. It makes a fool of me. It strings me through all this up and down and eventually breaks my heart.&rdquo; But, of course, he&rsquo;d wake up the next day and want nothing more than to write another song.<\/p>\n<p>In due-time he linked up with ace songwriter and GRAMMY award-winning producer Shane McAnally who signed Hayes to his SMACKSongs publishing company and soon released two volumes of Hayes&rsquo; music for free online &mdash; <em>8 Tracks, Vol. 1: Good Shit <\/em>and <em>8 Tracks, Vol. 2: Break the Internet<\/em>. As if without warning, the music quickly attracted a massive swell of popularity.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when you almost lose that you really realize that maybe you were born to do this no matter what,&rdquo; Hayes says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about success or anything &mdash; it&rsquo;s where you belong.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And now, with <em>boom.<\/em>, Hayes is ready to pull back the curtain entirely and give all of himself to his music, his fans, his family &ndash;everyone who has stuck with him on this long and sometimes painful journey.<\/p>\n<p>Just like his songs, Hayes&rsquo; live show is completely inimitable. Having long played showcases in the round &mdash; ones where he&rsquo;d sit on a barstool and tell stories before performing a tune; he now distinguishes his shows using a loop, he beatboxes, and he incorporates a backing band of musicians into the mix. &ldquo;The show is growing on a weekly basis,&rdquo; Hayes says. &ldquo;When a crowd is so electric that you can feed off their energy you feel kind of invincible up there. It is amazing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hayes isn&rsquo;t one to predict what comes next. All he&rsquo;ll tell you is that he&rsquo;ll be heeding his own advice because, hey, if nothing else, it&rsquo;s gotten him to this point. &ldquo;I started just trusting what felt right and what moved me and a lot of special songs came out,&rdquo; he says of <em>boom<\/em>. For Hayes, then, going forward the process remains the same. Says the singer of the road ahead: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to continue finding out who exactly I am.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WalkerHayes_11_32_33_AM_4_24_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"6:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/walkerhayes"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/walkerhayes\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7sKxqpSqbIzphAKAhrqvlf"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/walkerhayes"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/walkerhayes.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UClTsgdWILdO5vVN0w4j2x1g"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/17\/2019 11:32:49 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-grovelers":{"id":"5368","name":"The Grovelers","friendly_url":"the-grovelers","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TheGrovelers_12_33_31_AM_5_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"3:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/22\/2019 12:33:48 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"kase":{"id":"5369","name":"KASE","friendly_url":"kase","stages":"klements-sausage--beer-garden-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Searching and evolution is key in music and musicians &ndash; who evolved their style, sound, vocabulary, and musical identities.

Formed by blood brothers Nick and Steve Balkun, the duo has been described by TheDay.com as, &ldquo;Spectacular torch-bearers for rockin&rsquo; American blues. The band brings a raw, soulful and energetic personality that is a fresh sound for blues and rock &rsquo;n roll.&rdquo; The Hartford Courant also characterizes their sound as, \"Weaponized biker-bar blues rock, big on riffage but with a touch of soul and psychedelic freakouts\".<br \/> ?<br \/> Mixing heavy rock and funk grooves with traditional styles of delta and electric blues, Balkun Brothers are crafting a unique sound and style all their own. Defying the common logic of a duo act, Steve and Nick create a massive wall of sonic energy that draws from a vast range of influences including Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Johnny Winter, The Doors, Rage Against The Machine, Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Mot&ouml;rhead and many more. The band&rsquo;s live shows and in-studio recordings seamlessly transition between rock, blues, funk, jam, punk, psychedelia and everything in-between. Known for their explosive live shows, Balkun Brothers are quickly evolving into one of the USA&rsquo;s premier duo acts and they are rapidly gaining followers across the world with their gritty hard-rockin&rsquo; attitude.<br \/> ?<br \/> After being voted 'Best Blues Band in Connecticut' at the Connecticut Music Awards for the last 4 years in a row (from 2013-2016), the band was most recently awarded 'Best Rock Band in New England' at the 2017 New England Music Awards.<br \/> ?<br \/> Balkun Brothers has shared the stage with acts such as Johnny Winter, Joe Bonamassa, Gary Hoey, James Cotton, Gogol Bordello, Devon Allman, Melvin Seals and JGB, Eric Sardinas, Albert Castiglia, The Mike Dillon Band, Dopapod, Vapors of Morphine, Selwyn Birchwood and Chris Duarte. The duo has also been featured on major festival line-ups alongside The Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Motley Cr&uuml;e, Alice Cooper, Slayer, Iggy Pop, Gary Clark Jr. and Elvin Bishop.<br \/> ?<br \/> Brothers Nick and Steve, independently produced and released their debut album in 2015 entilted, 'ReDrova', which was well received and rose to #1 on the Roots Music Report Blues-Rock album charts and was #5 on the Roots Music Report overall Blues charts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Balkun Brothers signed with European label Dixiefrog Records in 2015 and&nbsp;released&nbsp;their much anticipated second album, 'Devil On TV', with Dixiefrog in May of 2017.<br \/> ?<br \/> On their mission to spread rock n' roll across the universe, the brothers have toured extensively throughout the United States from coast to coast. The band has also completed five European tours since 2015, performing in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BalkunBrothers_4_34_43_PM_4_24_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 1:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"1:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BalkunBrothers\/"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.balkunbrothers.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BalkunBrothers"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/balkunbrothers\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5j7w4WxKmI27wsfpQLL64G"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/balkunbrothers"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/24\/2019 04:38:14 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"tent-show-troubadours":{"id":"5374","name":"Tent Show Troubadours","friendly_url":"tent-show-troubadours","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p><strong>Tent Show Troubadours <\/strong>were formed by <strong>Bob Hoot<\/strong> and <strong>Doug McLeod<\/strong> in January 2016.

This has been singer-songwriter Patrick Park's experience with recording music -- exhausting all the sonic possibilities of a song, before finally succumbing to the ebb and flow of the creative process.<\/p>\n<p>After wrapping up the tour for his 2014 album, Love Like Swords, the weight of touring alone in a van for months, partnered with the financial realities of being a musician, began to take its toll. Park turned to writing songs for other artists, but, despite having success, he wasn't receiving creative fulfillment from the routine.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have an idea of the things that will make us happy, if we could just get them. But then we get them, and they're not what we thought they would be. Or we find that they're not enough and we want something else. Or we quickly lose them. And it's just this thing that goes on, and on, and on.\"<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Park found solace from the existential dread through meditation and working as a counselor on the suicide hotline. During this time, he began to write music for himself again, and those songs materialized as letters to his soon-to-be-born son and aural reckonings with the brevity of life. Park's forthcoming album, Here\/Gone -- due out April 26 -- encapsulates the incessant urge to chase things in life that only bring the most fleeting sense of fulfillment.<\/p>\n<p>\"We live in this world where eventually everybody's going to lose everything that they have,\" Park says. \"At some point or another, everything is going to fall apart. We go through life spending all of our time trying to build up this facade, in a lot of ways. We put a lot of work into getting people to see us in a way that we think looks good, but it's all very substanceless.\"<\/p>\n<p>The songs of Here\/Gone, such as \"Everything Falls Apart,\" draw on this phenomenon, but from a hopeful, as opposed to nihilistic, perspective. As the product of his meditative experiences, Park took a pared down and centered approach to the writing and production of the album. Using his \"exhaust all the possibilities\" method, Park recorded the album on his own in his studio, but he didn't feel as though the production properly served the sentiment of the project.<\/p>\n<p>\"I feel like sometimes I try to hide a little bit behind the production. Sometimes you just feel so naked out there without it,\" Park divulges. \"When I play live, I'm always exposed, but I've never made a record with that same feeling. It just seemed like this was the record to do it with, and these were the songs to do it with, and this was the time to do it.\"<\/p>\n<p>Stonewalled by his own frame of mind, Park decided to quit overworking the production and turn to Rob Schnapf (Beck, Kurt Vile, Elliott Smith) for a fresh perspective. After months of endless laboring on his own, Park and Schnapf were able to record Here\/Gone in simply two days. \"It was pretty fast,\" Park says. \"There wasn't a whole lot of going back and forth, working things out in the studio the way that there are a lot of times, just because I'd already done most of that on my own.\"<\/p>\n<p>The songs themselves speak to Park's musical resilience, such as the earnest persistence of \"Five Alarm.\" After coming up against wall after wall, Park's existential contemplations could have easily resulted in driving forbearance, but the songs sprouted into centered solace instead. Distilled to spare classic voice and guitar combinations, with string arrangements by Bobby Halvorson and occasional guest vocals from Emily Kokal (of Warpaint), Here\/Gone is a reflection upon how much is poured into hurrying time along when sometimes the most substantial form of fulfillment comes from simply letting go.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PatrickPark_6_57_25_PM_4_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 2 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 2","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/patrickparkmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/patrickpark1\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4I1ZPDoEcZOul26MTXDhNO"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Patrick_Park"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.patrickpark.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/patrickpark1"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/28\/2019 03:23:06 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-jimmys":{"id":"5422","name":"The Jimmys","friendly_url":"the-jimmys","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>It's always a special event when The Jimmys take the stage with their passion for the blues, R&amp;B, soul &amp; funk.

The MPs stands for MARINATED PUPPETS, which was the name of a band that a few of its mem<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">bers were a part of before they gave birth to this Milwaukee combo. Since 2009, their performances included some of southeastern Wisconsin's well-known venues (Miramar Theatre, Cactus Club, Up &amp; Under, The Domes, etc.). The band&rsquo;s founding members met while they were studying music at Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC). Their CD &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Do This!&rdquo; has been available for purchase since March 2013 and their newest release \"True Story\" has been available for purchase since June 2016. Jonny T-Bird &amp; the MPs is also a proud member of the Grafton Blues Association.<br \/><br \/>Jon \"Jonny T-Bird\" Neuberger (guitar\/vocals): The architect and bandleader of Jonny T-Bird &amp; the MPs. Some say you have to be born with the blues to play the blues. That was the case when Jon was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at an early age. Known as the mild form of the autism spectrum. But that didn't stop Jon from picking up the guitar at the age of thirteen. Back then, Jon studied under two of Milwaukee&rsquo;s guitar legends, Jeff Dagenhardt and Greg Koch. Jon was given the name JONNY T-BIRD while he was a student at Wauwatosa West High School and one of his teachers (Bob Bathurst) called him that name out of the blue. The more he did it, the more that name stuck. Jon was learning classic rock songs and played with various bands during his teenage years. While he went to college at both MATC and Carroll University, Jon finally decided to pursue his music into blues and jazz. Jon can also be found giving private guitar and bass lessons if he's not performing on stage.<br \/><br \/>\"Cadillac\" Craig Carter (bass\/vocals): Craig began his journey into the music world receiving his first bass guitar as a youngster. Craig excelled in his high school music program at West Division High school, while also joining his first band around the age 16. He later continued his studies in Instrumental performance at Berklee College of music in Boston, Massachusetts. Professionally trained in contemporary music Craig is able to play different genres of music from Blues, Reggae, Jazz and even Funk. He has played with bands such as the Misfits, Kojo Reggae Band, Wicked Long Day and many more. Craig's main interest is the Electric Bass Guitar and singing. He loves to put on a show while performing , which is how he received his nick name \"Cadillac Craig\" in the since that he's so smooth while playing on stage.<br \/><br \/>Anna Brinck (keys\/vocals): Ms. Anna Brinck is a veteran to the Milwaukee and Midwest music scene with her ticklin&rsquo; ivories ability. Lending her talents to The Elementals, The Best Westerns, Misha Siegfried, Dead Man&rsquo;s Carnival and now Jonny T-Bird &amp; the MPs. Influences ranging from Oscar Peterson, John Medeski, Tom Waits and Allen Toussaint is what&rsquo;s to be expected when hearing Ms. Brinck&rsquo;s playing. When she&rsquo;s not on stage, Anna Brinck is teaching private piano lessons. Ms. Brinck is currently attending UWM studying for her Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>\"Big Dad\" Robert Keelan (harmonica\/vocals): If there is such a thing as \"the fifth MP\", then it would have to be \"Big Dad\" Robert Keelan. A veteran to the Milwaukee blues scene. Robert started off as a drummer in his teenage years, before eventually switching to blues harmonica. Robert studied harmonica under two of Milwaukee's harp masters, Jim Liban &amp; Steve Cohen. On rare occasions, Big Dad can be seen with Jonny T-Bird's side project, \"The JONNY T-BIRD &amp; BIG DAD blues duo\".<br \/><br \/>Marcus \"MG\" Gibbons (drums):MG has toured and recorded with some of the biggest names in the US over the past 15 years of his professional career, including tours\/gigs with Keyshia Cole, Aaron Moore, Tweed Funk, Harvey Scales, The Esquires and as part of BB King&rsquo;s House Band in Memphis. Whether if he&rsquo;s with the MPs or someone else, MG&rsquo;s drumming style can lay down a funky groove, sit in the pocket, or hit hyper-drive with a flurry of fills and high-energy, mesmerizing drum solos.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Ben Hans (drums): Ben Hans is a musician, music instructor, and Hal Leonard author who keeps a busy performance schedule throughout the Upper Midwest. In addition to leading his own jazz trio, Ben performs as a fill-in drummer for Jonny T-Bird &amp; the MPs. He&rsquo;s also performed with a number of rock, jazz, and blues artists such as Jack Grassel, Kip Winger, Chuck Hedges, Barry Harris, Scott DuBois, and Tallan &ldquo;T-Man&rdquo; Latz.

This led him to a lengthy stint with Midwestern faves, Arroyo. His energy and talent together made him irresistible to audiences. Always in great demand, he has logged over a million hours on stage and in the studio, including providing vocals for advertising giants like McDonald&rsquo;s, Chevy, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Kellogg&rsquo;s.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Of course, an incredible singer who&rsquo;s also a smokin&rsquo; musician is going to write songs.&nbsp; Some earlier stuff that he wrote for the bands he was in won all kinds of awards. Derrick&rsquo;s songs have been recorded by The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, Logan Daniels and Melissa Manchester.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">You have heard Derrick&rsquo;s songs on My Name is Earl, TrueBlood, Criminal Minds, Boston Legal, Saving Grace, The Office, True Blood, and King of the Hill.

He loved music from a very young age. &ldquo;I've always loved music and was always listening to it! Remembering the lyrics to each song always came easy to me.&rdquo; His parents encouraged their young son to further his love for music, and he began taking piano lessons at the age of eight. He soon took a liking to drums and started lessons on the instrument until he discovered his voice &ndash; and that&rsquo;s when Derek&rsquo;s true musical journey began!<\/p>\n<p>From there, he moved on to performing with several successful local bands around town.<\/p>\n<p>Music has no doubt been an integral part throughout Derek&rsquo;s life. In fact, he hails from a musical family. &ldquo;My mother always played piano when I was growing up; she was very good at it. She was also a good singer. My brother was a drummer, my sister played the flute and my dad played guitar.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Growing up, one artist who truly impressed the budding musician was country music superstar, Garth Brooks. &ldquo;I really loved how Garth took country performance from just standing and singing to running around and being animated on stage. He really gave a show and was entertaining!&rdquo; Derek is also a self- proclaimed &ldquo;huge&rdquo; Brad Paisley fan, and he is equally as much so a fan of Jason Aldean. &ldquo;The influence of my country style has come from mostly those three artists for sure.&rdquo; In addition to country music, Derek also loves classic rock and 80s hair band music, and according to him, there might not be as large a gap between those genres as people might think! &ldquo;I think many of today&rsquo;s new country listeners who relate to that type of music are switching over to country and finding that it has some undertones of that 70s-80s rock in many of its new artists coming up. This, of course, is growing the country fan base even bigger!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Given his early appreciation for music, one might have guessed Derek would choose to pursue a career in music. He didn&rsquo;t, however, actually start thinking about making music a full-time career until a few years ago. &ldquo;I sang backup for many years, but I didn't have the courage to get out front and be lead singer until about six years ago.&rdquo; Thankfully, he has emerged from his shell and absolutely enjoys singing and performing these days!<\/p>\n<p>Once Derek made the decision to give it a go as a solo artist, things fell into place very quickly for him! &ldquo;I was playing locally and it seemed that more and more people were coming up to me after my shows and saying that I belong in Nashville. At first, I took that with a grain of salt. But after a few months, I decided to try and see if maybe I had a chance.&rdquo; As it turns out, Derek was rewarded with a welcoming reception from Nashville. &ldquo;It seemed like the stars aligned just right with things happening very fast and then, I had a recording contract!&rdquo; That contract opportunity came from Nashville-based Little House<\/p>\n<p>Records. The label helped Derek record and release his debut single, &ldquo;No Cool Way,&rdquo; which quickly found its way up the Music Row Breakout Chart, hitting the Top 75 within a few weeks; and peaked in the Top 40s! Now in the process of finishing his debut album, Derek has utilized a basic gauge when choosing songs for the project. &ldquo;I like well-written music with great lyrics that tell some sort of story,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;not just words fit to a melody or some basic melody built around words.&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll know he achieved his goal for the album when he has ten solid songs where any one of them could be released as a single. &ldquo;My whole goal for my album is to not have any &lsquo;filler&rsquo; songs. That&rsquo;s giving people their money&rsquo;s worth. I don't want to put only two great songs on there that people want to listen to; I want ten solid songs that make people take notice.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Being that he secured a recording contract pretty quickly and is enjoying success with &ldquo;No Cool Way&rdquo; right out of the chute, the fact of realizing how much goes on behind the scenes has been a big learning curve for Derek. He recaps some of the things he&rsquo;s learned so far. &ldquo;Once you sign a record deal, the hard work has just begun. You don't simply record a song and send it to radio for them to spin. The promotion of a single as a new artist is never ending. I have five of Nashville&rsquo;s top promoters promoting my single, plus a friend from New York. In addition, I make calls and follow up calls to thank the ones who are playing it. I've learned that every little bit helps and how valuable airtime is, so I've come to really appreciate every station that takes time in their extremely valuable programming time to play my song. Also, just because you have a song on the radio doesn't mean the gigs are going to roll in or that booking agents are going to be knocking down your door! There's just so much to know and learn about the music business!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Having learned a few things from his predecessors &ndash; including Garth, Brad, and Jason &ndash; Derek has refined his own stage show to be a high energy, up-tempo party! &ldquo;Anyone who knows me can tell you I'm not a very serious guy! I like to have fun on stage, and I want my fans to have fun too! I want to make sure people come away from my shows feeling like they got their money&rsquo;s worth, and they want to come back again and again.&rdquo; Though he prefers singing ballads, he makes sure to include many high- energy songs in his set lists that make the audience want to get out of your seat and dance! Derek describes his own musical style as being country southern rock. &ldquo;I love traditional country, but I love contemporary country and southern rock as well. I am equally comfortable singing in any of those three styles, so I try to mix them and give people what they want to hear!&rdquo; One thing he is not interested in is making &ldquo;cookie cutter&rdquo; music. &ldquo;I want to stay true to myself and the music I create.\"<\/p>\n<p>Since his debut release, Derek has gradually transitioned from holding a 9-to-5 day job to making a full- time career out of his music. Part of that transitional process included leaving his home state of New York and moving to Music City. &ldquo;The plan is to continue to get my music career rolling, but it isn't cheap. Everything takes money, and it's hard as a new artist to line up enough gigs to call it making a living.<\/p>\n<p>Booking agents don't want to sign you unless you've already had some road success, have a steady stream of gigs, or have a big name already working, so a lot of times it is frustrating.&rdquo; Then again, Derek realizes, &ldquo;If it were easy, everyone would be doing it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>If you asked Derek whether he ever thought he&rsquo;d really get this far, his answer is &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Realizing that success can be fleeting in the music business, Derek is even more grateful for the success that he has already enjoyed. He admits, &ldquo;I want it so bad, but so do so many other artists. There's no rhyme or reason as to who gets noticed and who doesn't. For some, it&rsquo;s talent; for others, it&rsquo;s luck of the draw; and for others still, it&rsquo;s as simple as being at the right place at the right time. I thank my lucky stars that I have been fortunate enough to find a record label willing to take a chance on me, that believe in me and my voice, and that thinks people will want to hear my music. So far, so good! I couldn't ask for more.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>His early success has only motivated him to continue learning about the music business and creating music that he and his fans can be proud of! &ldquo;EVERYTHING about what I do is about trying to be top- notch. From the music we play, to the songs we select for my album, to the quality of shirt we produce for the fans to purchase, I never want someone to feel they got short-changed!&rdquo; Derek believes this philosophy also extends toward the people who are buying his music, and therefore makes sure to let each of his fans know how much he truly appreciates their support. &ldquo;People tell me I'm a very likeable person and that my personality alone is going to take me a long way. I love meeting and talking to my fans! It's not unusual for my wife and I to go out to dinner with fans or hang out with them. Like everyone else, we like to have fun. I take time with every fan that wants to talk to me.&rdquo; His approachability coupled with the type of live show he gives has helped tremendously in gaining supporters as quickly as he has.<\/p>\n<p>As far as the future is concerned, Derek would eventually like to be invited to perform on the Grand Ole Opry stage as well as be one of the artists featured on the Nightly Stage at a future CMA Music Festival event!<\/p>\n<p>As long as he continues to create tiptop quality projects for his fans, we should be hearing a LOT more from Derek Joseph in the coming years!<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DerekJoseph_10_15_59_AM_6_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 5 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 5","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":""},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.derekjoseph.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RxVFJ-ytGsQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/13\/2019 03:39:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-incorruptibles":{"id":"5447","name":"The Incorruptibles","friendly_url":"the-incorruptibles","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>The Incorruptibles are a vocal-driven trio from Milwauke playing roots rock &amp; roll, rockabilly and blues.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_IncorruptiblesThe_9_58_09_PM_4_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 6 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 6","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/theincorruptiblesband.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/22\/2019 11:46:11 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"gabe-burdulis":{"id":"5448","name":"Gabe Burdulis","friendly_url":"gabe-burdulis","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":"<p>Gabe Burdulis is a 22 year-old singer-songwriter based out of Nashville, TN. His roots began in Madison, WI where he spent most of his time playing at bars, staying out way too late for school nights. Burdulis began teaching himself guitar after he first picked up his fathers guitar in 7th grade. Writing and performing became a passion very early on, he started playing in multiple bands locally including playing guitar for drum legend, Clyde Stubblefield. Before graduating high school, Burdulis had already become a two-time recipient of the &ldquo;Les Paul Launchpad Award&rdquo; and won multiple &ldquo;Madison Area Music Awards&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After declining a scholarship to Berklee School of Music he moved to Nashville at the age of 18 without knowing a soul.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Since then, he has played iconic venues like the Bluebird Cafe, performed with Grammy Winning band Los Lobos at The Ryman Auditorium, and even caught the attention of Sheryl Crow when she attended his bands show in Nashville, TN followed by a post on her social media saying &ldquo;They blew me away! Check them out!!&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Burdulis has toured the country playing major festivals including the world&rsquo;s largest music festival, Summerfest, and shared stages with Acts like X Ambassadors, Sylvan Esso, Cheap Trick, B.O.B. and Wynona Judd. He spent most of 2017 on the road with his duo, Future Stuff, opening for acclaimed guitarist, Doyle Bramhall II who went on to produce their record full length record (soon to be released).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mixing bluesy roots and a love for pop melodies, Burdulis&rsquo; music sits somewhere in a more folk\/americana based style. Picking up on early influences like Cat Stevens and James taylor and some more contemporary influences like John Mayer and The Weepies, his lyrics are meaningful with a strong acoustic driven feel. His live shows are energetic yet intimate whether it be solo or with a band.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Gabe&rsquo;s music has the acoustic pop power of an Ed Sheeran song with better guitar playing and a bit more country thrown into the mix. There&rsquo;s something in the subtle finger pickings and vocal flourishes that wears both his Midwest roots and his new southern home proudly. Despite his songwriting power, Gabe doesn&rsquo;t let his ego get in the way; he is an incredibly sympathetic songwriter, with songs about his grandmother and the failings of the modern dating age.&rdquo; - Landon Kuhlmann of Daytrotter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Burdulis is set to release a new solo record this summer along with a string of national tour dates!<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/StageGraphics\/16.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/Www.facebook.com\/gabe.burdulis"},{"type":"instagram","link":"http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gabeburdulis"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/gabeburdulis"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/Www.gabeburdulis.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/gabeburdulis"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/20\/2019 11:46:50 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"madison-county":{"id":"5449","name":"Madison County","friendly_url":"madison-county","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p><p>This 7-piece country show band based out of Madison, Wisconsin, most recently winners of the 2013 Isthmus Madison's Favorite Local Country Group as well as 2014 Best of Madison - Best Local Band (Gold Award), and voted as Local Group of the Year for 9 consecutive years at the Q106 MCMA Awards Shows, as well as Country Artist of the Year at the MAMA Awards Show, and WAMI People\u2019s Choice 6 years in a row, has acquired a fan-base like no other!<\/p><p>Mike Zibell, 4 year Q106 MCMA Male Vocalist of the Year, along with his uncle Augie Zibell, also a Q106 MCMA Male Vocalist of the Year, give the band very rich harmonies that go with this very talented and versatile group of instrumentalists which includes Ron Granberg on drums, Scott Mitchell on bass, Dan Mahieu on keyboards, Angel Salinas on lead guitar, and Jess Lex on fiddle.<\/p><p>They've recorded 3 full CD's (Diamond In the Rough, Make My Way Back Home, and Enjoy the Ride), as well as a six-song EP (Perspective), which they recorded with an Indie Label in Nashville.

His answer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you to ask.&rdquo; Rehearsals began soon thereafter with the addition of Michael Juley on bass. The trio first performed in April 2013 in Waukesha, and after a successful first year and with festivals beginning to call, including Bastille Days in 2014, the band added drummer Jeff Franks.<\/p>\n<p>The father-daughter band released its first CD in 2015 and immediately began getting airplay on two radio stations in southeastern Wisconsin. The EP was recorded at Third Ward Records in St. Francis and featured five songs written by Tyler and a cover of &ldquo;End of the World&rdquo; by Skeeter Davis.<\/p>\n<p>A second CD, &ldquo;Volume Two,&rdquo; was released in 2017 and contained seven songs written by Tyler. In its first year of release, the album received airplay on five radio stations in southeastern Wisconsin, including FM 106.1, the most popular country music station in the Milwaukee area and a contributing sponsor of the U.S. Cellular Connection Stage. A Kenosha County station, WGTD-FM, called one of the album&rsquo;s cuts, &ldquo;Picture of You,&rdquo; the best locally produced song ever played on the station. And in August 2017, the band recorded two videos for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sound Check.&rdquo; It also recorded two of its songs for WUWM-FM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lake Effect&rdquo; program.<\/p>\n<p>A review of &ldquo;Volume Two&rdquo; in the Shepherd Express stated:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any band whose motto is &ldquo;Bringing back the art of playing music&rdquo; has set a lofty critical bar for themselves. On their second release, Milwaukee&rsquo;s Rebecca and the Grey Notes perform increasingly assured chin-ups on that bar with a smart, sincere amalgam of unassumingly sweet acoustic country, light blues-rock swagger and a hooky sort of Americana. The familial bond of lead singer Rebecca Famularo and the presence of her lead guitarist-father among her three Grey Notes put them in the city&rsquo;s parent-child lineage of The Spanic Boys, an act whose rootsiness aptly parallels their sound, too.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its 12 original songs, the band fills out its set lists with covers of artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Feist, Linda Ronstadt, Ann Peebles, Alison Krauss, Patsy Clline, Led Zeppelin, the Byrds, the Tedeschi-Trucks Band, B.B. King and more, covering a wide range of styles and genres.<\/p>\n<p>The band includes:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rebecca<\/strong>, the heart and soul of the band. She has been singing her whole life. Her voice has been compared to Norah Jones, Susan Tedeschi, Linda Ronstadt and Bonnie Raitt, and her musical influences include bands such as Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers. In addition to her sweet and soaring vocals, she plays a mean rhythm guitar. She lives in Wauwatosa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tyler<\/strong>, one of Milwaukee&rsquo;s finest guitar players and Rebecca&rsquo;s father. He began playing guitar at age 11, and by 14 he had his first real guitar and amp, a 1965 Fender Telecaster and &lsquo;65 Delux Reverb. He has played as a lead guitarist in the Larry Lynne Group, the Balloons, Sky Harbor, the Bandits and the Brandon James Band, which was led by his son. Tyler, who has written all of the band&rsquo;s original music, also is lead guitarist for the Smooth Blues Band and the Differentials. He is proud to say that he played in a band at the first Summerfest. He lives in Pewaukee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Michael,<\/strong> who has played bass since 1982. After taking piano lessons in grade school, Michael switched to clarinet in high school, then didn&rsquo;t pick up another musical instrument until 1982, when he taught himself to play bass guitar and joined a Milwaukee &rsquo;50s-&rsquo;60s group, Granite. Since then the retired newspaper journalist has recorded and played with several Milwaukee-area pop, rock, country and blues bands, including the Brandon James Band, which was led by Rebecca&rsquo;s brother. He plays a 1978 Fender Jazz bass, a 1963 reissued Hofner bass and a Warwick fretless bass. He lives in Greendale.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jeff<\/strong>, also known as Circus Jeff. He played his first gig in 1978 and in college toured the U.S. with the 25-piece brass band Dimensions in Brass, led by his father, legendary trumpet player and music educator Jerry Franks. Jeff earned his nickname &ldquo;Circus Jeff&rdquo; after many years touring the world with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and many other circus bands. Formerly of Nashville, Jeff has played with several national artists and has a passionate style of playing that anchors the Grey Notes&rsquo; sound.

With groups like Mumford &amp; Sons, The Avett Brothers, and Dawes setting the tone, the sub-genre of acoustic folk rock made its way to mainstream radio and captured an incredible and very loyal fan base. With the release of their Nashville-recorded album Hand Me Down Miracles, the Esperanto EP, and the most recent Trust and Bones album, The Mascot Theory is set to be the next band in that category to make a major impact, as they have quickly moved up the popularity ranks of Madison's music scene with their infectious songwriting and energetic live shows. They balance on an alternative folk influence and pull it together with a rootsy bluegrass blended Americana feel to give something that fits alongside their counterparts, but also has enough freshness to it to give it a unique spin and create their own sound as well, with a sonic backbone of 4-part harmony swells. Along with a 2017 WAMI (Wisconsin Area Music Industry) win for Best Male Vocalist (Erik Kjelland) and a nomination for Best Americana\/folk artist, The Mascot Theory has won 18 MAMA (Madison Area Music Association) awards including back to back 2016 and 2017 Artist of the Year awards.&nbsp; They have played major festivals throughout the Wisconsin including Summerfest, Freak Fest, and Mile of Music Festival, and have shared the stage with BoDeans, Vance Joy, Frank Turner, Gin Blossoms, Chase Rice, Kaleo, The Wild Feathers, Guster, Blitzen Trapper, Cory Chisel, Andy Frasco and the UN, Don McLean, and Miles Nielsen and the Rusted Hearts.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MascotTheory_5_47_02_PM_6_3_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 2:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"2:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheMascotTheory\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/themascottheory"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/themascottheory"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/themascottheory.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/03\/2019 05:57:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"wooldridge-brothers":{"id":"5458","name":"Wooldridge Brothers","friendly_url":"wooldridge-brothers","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>After showcasing at SXSW in the late 90&rsquo;s the Wooldridge Brothers (Scott and Brian Wooldridge) inked a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific\/EMI and released three critically acclaimed albums.

Taking pride in their flaws and finding joy in sharing their fearlessness, Capitano seem to gather likeminded people across genres, genders, races and beliefs, whose disapproval for a typecast society led them right into the iridescent bubble of energy that is Capitano.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CAPITANO_11_18_09_AM_5_22_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 4:15 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"4:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CapitanoBand"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hicapitano\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1VmW3RVGmdeKyZmnuuhJXU"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hicapitano"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.capitanomusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC1Z-d_HU7eca9qU91dVuWjg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/25\/2019 08:22:20 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"seasaw":{"id":"5516","name":"Seasaw","friendly_url":"seasaw","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":"<p>Meg Golz and Eve Wilczewski started as co-workers, slowly courted each other into best friendship, and then magically into music-making conspirators - all along, guiding the ship that is their indie-pop duo Seasaw.

Long-time Stone Caravan members Sam LaMonica (Drums) and Greg Lykins (Guitar) were joined in 2015 by Jerry Scaringe (Bass) after the sudden passing of Mr. Lou DeMartino in 2015. Joe D'Urso serves on the board of directors for Light of Day, WhyHunger and The Dan Sullivan Foundation and owns and curates the Rockland-Bergen Music Festival (rocklandmusicfestival.com).<\/p>\n<p>Joe D'Urso &amp; Stone Caravan, an Americana\/Jersey Shore\/Rock &amp; Roll band, released their 13th CD on SCR\/Schoolhouse Records, titled \"Sway\" in January 2013. The 12-song CD was recorded in Nyack, NY and features 9 songs written or co-written by D'Urso and three tunes penned by Willie Nile, Steven Van Zandt and the late Terence Martin. \"Sway\" is an upbeat, rocking record and covers some good territory on the Americana\/Jersey Shore\/rock and roll painter's pallet as the CD runs the gamut of straight-up Americana rock and roll, singer-songwriter offerings, Jersey Shore influences and New York State\/Catskill Mountain country tinged instrumentation.<\/p>\n<p>Joining drummer Sam LaMonica, bassist Mr. Lou DeMartino, guitarist Greg Lykins and D'Urso on \"Sway\" is Rita Harvey, Tony Pallagrosi, Neil Berg, The Maddog Horns, Steve Pavia, Greg Talenfeld, and Gordon Roehrer on voices, piano, horns, organ and cello.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, JD&amp;SC released their 12th CD on SCR\/Schoolhouse Records, titled \"Down Here By The River,\". The 14-song CD was recorded throughout 2009 in JD&amp;SC's home area of Rockland County, New York and features 11 songs written or co-written by D'Urso and three tunes penned by Marah (Round Eye Blues), Little Steve Van Zandt (All I Needed Was You) and the BoDeans (Angels). The 11 D'Urso songs\/co-writes are \"Down Here By The River,\" \"Waiting On A Train,\" \"Mystery,\" \"On A Night Like This,\" \"Anything More,\" \"Since She's Been Gone,\" \"Once Again,\" \"Loving and Living,\" \"Hold On,\" \"Brass Ring\" and \"LaGuardia To Weehawken (or From Grave To Save)\" and finds Stone Caravan (Sam LaMonica on drums, Greg Lykins on guitars, Mr. Lou DeMartino on bass and D'Urso on acoustic guitars) joined by an array of vocalist friends: Willie Nile, Danny Zolli, Joe Rapolla, Carter Calvert, Dave McKeon and Tim O'Donohue. Joining JD&amp;SC is Stone Caravan alumnus Chuck Chesler on organ\/accordion\/piano, Perry Paletta on mandolin, Dave Yannuzzi on lap steel\/dobro, Dave McKeon on banjo and Darren Lunar on percussion.<\/p>\n<p>With its flowing river images throughout many songs, the CD ends with the co-written song \"LaGuardia to Weehawken (or From Grave To Save)\" with lyrics from D'Urso's boyhood friend, Steve O'Brien, who was a passenger on Flight 1549 that safely landed in the Hudson River. 2010 found D'Urso, both solo and with Stone Caravan, traveling the world once again.<\/p>\n<p>In April of 2009 JD&amp;SC released their first live recording \"One More Song Live\" on SCR\/Schoolhouse Records. This 32-track double CD was recorded in June 2008 at the legendary Turning Point in Piermont, New York and serves as a showcase of the band's energetic live performances. The live CD includes D'Urso-penned fan favorites like\"Rock and Roll Call,\" \"Noisy Guitars,\" \"Welcome Home,\" \"Tell Me Why,\" \"So Tired,\" \"Numb,\" \"Minute To Midnight,\" \"Glow\" and many others.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2006, JD&amp;SC released \"Cause...\" The 15-song \"album\" is divided into Side One and Side Two with topics ranging from friendship, war, marriage, oil, soul searching, and lost love. As in past offerings, D'Urso mixed his writing and music with full-out rockers and quiet observations. \"Cause...\" was recorded with more of a live, garage rock feel than previous offerings and is quite unique as it's \"narrated\" by wise musings\/introductions by the late Harry Chapin. Besides 12 new D'Urso originals, JD&amp;SC took on John Stewart's 1979 Top 5 hit \"Gold\", Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released\" and Chapin's \"Taxi\".<\/p>\n<p>This CD followed up 2005's \"Best 1991-2003\". The 19-song compilation scans D'Urso's songwriting from a Greenwich Village startup to international independent touring artist. The CD includes 16 songs chosen by fans through JD&amp;SC's website, as well as three unreleased songs. Also released was the band's foray into video with the DVD \"3 Days in Italy,\" which documents two Italian performances in February 2004. This DVD was released through the band's \"Bootleg Series\" as it was shot and recorded by Italian fans.<\/p>\n<p>Stone Caravan has come a long way since founding members Joe D'Urso, Dan Albanese, Rich Sica and Bob Place got together in the summer of 1989 in a crammed bedroom in Long Island City, NY and started what was to become a road less traveled. The band was originally named \"Three Chords &amp; The Truth\" but after six months was renamed \"Stone Caravan\" and then renamed \"Joe D&rsquo;Urso &amp; Stone Caravan\" upon releasing their third record in 1993 \"Rock-Land\".<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JoeDUrsoStoneCaravan_2_37_12_PM_5_2_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 27 - 2:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 27","start_time":"2:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jdcaravan.com\/"},{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JOEDURSOandSTONECARAVAN\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/caravanmanagement\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joedursocbgb"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/25\/2019 10:53:18 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"gregory-hyde":{"id":"5521","name":"Gregory Hyde","friendly_url":"gregory-hyde","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Gregory Hyde is a Chicago-based Singer\/Songwriter whose bombastic melodic rock has received comparisons to a broad array of artists such as Weezer, The Eagles, and Jellyfish.<\/p>\n<p>Hyde has has performed live on national radio, had his songs placed in award-winning films, documentaries, &amp; shows, sold over 7,000 copies of his independently produced albums, and is a recipient of the Billboard Music Songwriting award.<\/p>\n<p>Gregory has toured with and shared the stage with notable&nbsp;performers like Jay Leno, Jim Gaffigan, Barenaked Ladies, Soul Asylum, Pat Benatar, 10,000 Maniacs, Sister Hazel, Gin Blossoms, Toad the Wet Sprocket, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hyde seamlessly leaps across genres and effortlessly blends classic and modern covers with originals that hold their ground among chart-topping hits.&rdquo; - Chicago Sun-Times<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;First-class pop rock centered on accessible song arrangement and big choruses &hellip;seasoned songwriting and near-perfect melodic rock primed for the masses.&rdquo; - VOX Magazine<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GregoryHyde_12_51_17_AM_5_24_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 3:30 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"3:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/24\/2019 12:53:20 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"wildside":{"id":"5522","name":"Wildside","friendly_url":"wildside","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Wildside_2_12_48_PM_5_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 12:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"12:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/24\/2019 10:58:35 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"that-90s-band":{"id":"5523","name":"That 90's Band","friendly_url":"that-90s-band","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-26","long_dates":"June 26","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 26","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_That90sBand_1_49_31_PM_5_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 26 - 2:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 26","start_time":"2:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/21\/2019 01:49:50 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-unxpected":{"id":"5525","name":"The UnXpected","friendly_url":"the-unxpected","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":"<p><p>Playing the greatest variety of classic party hits from the 1950\u2019s to 2011.

His track \"Roller Coaster\" rose to #3 on the Beatport charts during its first week, and he followed it with the epic MAKJ collaboration \"Knock Me Down,\" which was licensed by Starz for their 2017 fall season promo. That same year Styler experimented with whimsical melodies and vocals on &ldquo;Secrets&rdquo; featuring CXLOE and &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo; with Nevve, before shifting to more festival-oriented material in 2018. &ldquo;Shakalaka,&rdquo; his four way collaboration with Steve Aoki, Deorro and MAKJ, amassed close to a million plays in the first week of being released and the artists came together to perform the track at Coachella 2018. The year was later highlighted by his acclaimed EP, <em>Feel It<\/em>. The EP&rsquo;s title track became Styler&rsquo;s best performing record at radio to date, peaking at #24 on Billboard&rsquo;s Dance\/Mix Show Airplay Chart and earning regular rotation at key dance radio platforms such as iHeartRadio&rsquo;s Evolution and SiriusXM&rsquo;s BPM. Outside of his own original material, Styler also lent his production touch to a collaborative remix (with TWERL) of Diplo and Lil Xan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Color Blind&rdquo; and was also tapped to assemble a mix for BBC Radio 1&rsquo;s Diplo and Friends show.

The group formed to answer one simple question: Can a string quartet truly rock?<\/p><p>In the past, many string groups have transcribed pop and rock songs and performed them as a kind of novelty to keep audiences awake or try to seem \u201chip\u201d.  These attempts are usually amusing for a while but have no lasting musical validity in that the performers invariably \u201cmiss the mark\u201d musically.  It is interesting to note that when string players perform works from various eras of the \u201cClassical\u201d genre,(i.e.- Baroque, Romantic, etc.) they vary their musical approach to suit the style of the music.  However, when it comes to pop or rock music, virtually no thought is ever given to exactly what the music is about and what gives it its power.  Rock music is viewed by classical performers as a simple folk art form that presents little or no challenges intellectually or musically. <\/p><p>While in regards to harmony and structure this sometimes might be the case, what these musicians miss is that rock music is powerful and challenging in different ways.  There are a variety of colors of sound in rock music that come from the experimentation of countless performers with electrical effects, instrumentation that most string players simply ignore.<\/p><p>Joe 2.0 has decided to jump with both feet into this world, electrifying the instruments, using a drum set, and adding the world class vocals of original \"Cheap Trick\" front man, Xeno.  The attempt is to create a totally new pop sound without the use of traditional \"rock\" instruments such as guitars, keyboards, basses, etc..

Spirituality is for those who have already been there&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve been there a few times.&rdquo; &ndash; Tom Fuller, singer\/songwriter and rock band leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Freedom\" is the current album from Tom Fuller, showcasing his outstanding lyrics and emotional singing style. Recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, before being mixed at the historic FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and mastered at London&rsquo;s legendary Abbey Road Studios, \"Freedom\" features eleven songs about a life lived, built on a foundation of hard-earned wisdom, heartbreak, addiction, love, loss and hope.<\/p>\n<p>Born and bred in Chicago, Tom&rsquo;s \"Freedom\" album embodies the soul and creative energy of his hometown&rsquo;s rich musical heritage. Combining the melodic pop-rock sensibilities of Cheap Trick and a will to evolve worthy of Wilco, \"Freedom\" also doffs its cap to Fuller&rsquo;s love of classic English bands such as The Hollies and the Rubber Soul and Revolver-era Beatles.<\/p>\n<p>When Tom was a boy he wanted to be two things: a businessman and a rocker. He grew up to be both. However, life&rsquo;s obstacles would get in the way of a career in music until fifteen years ago, when Fuller discovered he could write songs that people wanted to hear. Fuller says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I was able to take my music seriously.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Ever since then he has worked with hit producer Rick Chudacoff, who over the years has helped create Tom Fuller&rsquo;s unique sound. Fuller released his debut album \"Chasing An Illusion\" in 2005, and followed-up with 2008&rsquo;s \"Abstract Man\" and 2011&rsquo;s \"Ask,\" of which the latter Tom recorded with two of Paul McCartney&rsquo;s bandmates, drummer Abe Laboriel, Jr. and guitarist Brian Ray. However, Fuller freely admits that, lyrically, it&rsquo;s taken until now to put his cards on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been hiding behind metaphors, but with &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo;&hellip;now I&rsquo;m taking you into my real life. I needed to wear my heart on my sleeve, but it isn&rsquo;t always an easy thing to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For Tom Fuller, the \"Freedom\" he refers to is from emotional pain: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of encounters with alcohol and the &lsquo;ism&rsquo; that follows that. It was my escape, but I went downhill and it soon became a choice between living or dying &ndash; and I didn&rsquo;t have a chance until I heard the songs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s title track, however, was the most difficult for the Windy City troubadour to write.

It began as two kids in their hometown of Canterbury, England, and is now one adult based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Originally consisting of Aymen and his friend, Ryan Hurley, the band released their debut record, Congratulations, in April of 2016 and embarked on a restless tour-schedule involving runs in the UK, Europe and the United States to support the release. Receiving favorable coverage from websites such as the AV Club, The Alternative and Gold Flake Paint, Congratulations ruminated heavily on the choice of whether to take root and nurture close relationships or live headless-chickenly - chasing travel, experience and dreams of becoming a musician.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> After Ryan&rsquo;s departure from the band, Aymen would end up choosing the latter - stripping out the backseats of the band&rsquo;s passenger van to install a mattress and make-shift bedroom while on tour in the United States. The project therefore temporarily became more of a solo endeavor and nomadic entity, and during this time he released the stop-gap Tales from the Traveling T-Shirt Salesman EP in the barmy World Cup summer of 2018.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> After an initial visit to Milwaukee, inspired by his love of fabled 90&rsquo;s local emo bands The Promise Ring and Maritime, Aymen ended up settling in the &ldquo;cream city&rdquo; on a whim. Finding a home in local haunts such as the Highbury Pub, and penning a one-off single, about aforementioned pub and his new life, called &ldquo;Wisconsin&rdquo;, he ingratiated himself in the local music scene - finding the music in rotation on 88.9 Radio Milwaukee and a piece in the Wisconsin Gazette. Now settled in an adopted hometown, Holy Pinto turns to release the sophomore record, Adult.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Adult explores love, the paths we choose in life, the tyranny of distance, and the bittersweet taste of nostalgia. Bookended by two short-songs, titled Adult #1 and #2, the foundation of the record is a reflection on the technicality of being an adult through age - but feeling alien from the stability or maturity that it insinuates. The fun and sugary sweet &ldquo;Gold Leaf&rdquo; sees a twisted latin beat blended with an infectious sing-along pop chorus, while &ldquo;Daisychain&rdquo; finds you swimming from mood to mood, passing through golden-lens nostalgia to the sadness of lost love, before culminating in a shred guitar solo comprised of a cocktail of mandolin, synth and electric guitar.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> There are two places in which you can find Aymen these days. One is singing his songs on tour - whether it be a real venue, a bar in a one-person town in Nebraska or a barn in rural Pennsylvania. The other is at the Highbury Pub in Milwaukee on a Sunday morning, drinking Mal&ouml;rt.

The Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York artist emerged in the late 1980s, delivering next-level rhymes as part of Marley Marl&rsquo;s Juice Crew with Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Kool G. Rap and others. After his 1990 debut album, he then released in 1993 a sobering treatise on gangster rap and its impact on America with his SlaughtaHouse project before melding an East Coast sensibility with the South and West Coast&rsquo;s affinity for car culture with 1995&rsquo;s revolutionary, forward-thinking Sittin&rsquo; On Chrome album.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it was Masta Ace&rsquo;s next series of musical moves that truly cemented his status as one of rap&rsquo;s iconic acts. In 2001, Ace released Disposable Arts, an exceptional look at rap&rsquo;s evolution, exploitation and appropriation. His subsequent projects &ndash; 2004&rsquo;s A Long Hot Summer, 2012&rsquo;s MA_DOOM: Son of Yvonne and collaborative projects with eMC, Ed O.G. and others &ndash; provided Masta Ace a new platform to tour the world and become a rapper whose catalog is appreciated by different generations of fans for dramatically different reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My longevity can only be attributed to the music I have dropped since 2001,&rdquo; Masta Ace says. &ldquo;Those subsequent albums have garnered a whole new legion of fans for me. Typically your fan base grows old with you. My fan base has also grown younger with me. Having young fans show up at sound check to get an autograph because they are too young to get into the club for the show says it all.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This steadfast fan support set the stage for Masta Ace&rsquo;s forthcoming The Falling Season LP. Due in the first quarter of 2016, the album is narrated by Fats Belvedere, his A Long Hot Summer sidekick.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was inspired to again reach back to my past and tell more of my story,&rdquo; Masta Ace explains of The Falling Season. &ldquo;This album takes you back to my high school days. A Long Hot Summer was more fictional-based, but The Falling Season is more autobiographical. It pulls heavily from actual events that took place during those years.&rdquo; It was an event in 2000, though, that helped redirect Masta Ace&rsquo;s personal life. That year, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), though he did not reveal to the public that he had the disease until 2013. Living with MS led Ace to have a new dedication to health and fitness, something that impacted every aspect of his life, notably his music.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have simply become more introspective as I have grown older,&rdquo; Masta Ace reveals. \"The realities of life and our mortality on this earth have caused me to look within and pull from those emotions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This new-found perspective led Masta Ace to collaborate with Runtastic as a story running voice actor, with Lowland Kings on a skateboard design due this winter and with Ous shoe company on a signature shoe due in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My non-music ventures have provided me with a clear exit strategy from the game,&rdquo; Masta Ace says. &ldquo;My ideas and interests span beyond music and I look forward to showcasing the other creations in the near future.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Now, with a career that stretches back to the 1980s and shows no signs of slowing, Masta Ace continues pushing art in general &ndash; and music specifically &ndash; forward. &ldquo;I think I have contributed music that has challenged the status quo in hip-hop,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I have given heartfelt music that moves listeners emotionally, music that does more than make you wanna do something. I made you feel something and think about something.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Masterful, indeed.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MastaAce_1_44_12_PM_5_20_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mastaaceofficial\/?ref=br_tf"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mastaacepics\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1wo9h8DP7M0M1orKuGZgWv"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mastaace"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.mastaace.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/10\/2019 01:28:39 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dj-shawna":{"id":"5917","name":"DJ Shawna","friendly_url":"dj-shawna","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p class=\"textbox\" dir=\"ltr\">Shawna Nicols, better known as&nbsp;DJ Shawna, is one of the Midwest's premier open format DJs.

Levi witnessed firsthand how to dream big and how to make those dreams happen.<\/p>\n<p>But growing up in Nashville and being the eldest son of such accomplished parents didn&rsquo;t cement his destiny in the city&rsquo;s ever-evolving music business. In fact, there was a time when Levi didn&rsquo;t even consider music as a future.<\/p>\n<p>Levi remembers, &ldquo;I would be going to these country music events and meeting people like the Dixie Chicks and Rascal Flatts, and I would be listening to music like the White Stripes and Outkast, but every time I would pick up a guitar, it would be country music. I never picked up a guitar and wanted to write a rock song. One of the first songs that I wrote was called &lsquo;Dance with Me,&rsquo; and out of all the crazy punk music I liked, it was about a guy and a girl that wanted to dance together in a church.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years and it was actually another activity that became the unconventional and eventual doorway to Hummon&rsquo;s musical career. &ldquo;I loved skateboarding and music is really ingrained in that culture as well,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For me, it started with the Ramones, The Clash, then it became Jeff Buckley, then Mumford and Sons. I think that was just another element of me searching for my creative self.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Still hoping to carve his own path, he enrolled in college in Florida to pursue a degree in visual arts. However, he combined painting and sculpting with music, creating his own hybrid of art and design. It seemed inevitable that he would return to his roots.<\/p>\n<p>Levi admits, &ldquo;I was always searching for what I wanted to do creatively, whether it was painting or sculpting. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was going to be my thing. It turns out songwriting was the most honest version of myself. Melodies were the thing, that&rsquo;s what got me into music because I love this idea that you can sing notes that make people feel something and that are unique and interesting. Yes, my dad is a musician, but he pushed us to be painters, he pushed us to go outside and just live. I wasn&rsquo;t searching for something musical, music just found me in that environment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Returning to Nashville and enrolling in Belmont University, Levi began developing his songwriting, refining the craft with the help of other writers, but forming his own voice.<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by his father&rsquo;s catalog of country hits, including Tim McGraw&rsquo;s &ldquo;One of These Days,&rdquo; the Dixie Chicks&rsquo; &ldquo;Cowboy Take Me Away,&rdquo; Sara Evans&rsquo; &ldquo;Born to Fly,&rdquo; and Wynonna Judd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Only Love,&rdquo; Levi dove in to Nashville&rsquo;s rich writing community and began with a loose philosophy for himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so important for me to be honest. I think that&rsquo;s the number-one thing in music. I just want to write what I&rsquo;m feeling and who I am. If I&rsquo;m not saying, singing and feeling what I&rsquo;m singing, then I shouldn&rsquo;t be singing it at all. How I&rsquo;ve learned how to do that is sitting in rooms with great writers and figuring out ways to be excited, because you write so many songs that are all about love or other things you&rsquo;ve written about before. Figuring out new ways to say that keeps me stoked. He continues, &ldquo;Your listeners are going to sense dishonesty. If you have a no holds barred attitude with everything you write, I feel like it becomes way more authentic and that integrity that I need in my life exists in my music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, he can credit his mother equally for instilling a commitment to integrity and doing the right thing. Becca Stevens is a best-selling author, ordained priest, and founder of the non-profit organizations Magdalene and Thistle Farms, facilities that assist survivors of human trafficking, prostitution, and drug addiction. Her efforts have enlightened an entire community and inspired her son to write a song entitled &ldquo;Love Heals.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I grew up watching her create Magdalene and Thistle Farms here in Nashville,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the most powerful things I&rsquo;ve ever seen and it&rsquo;s truly an example of how love has the power to change people&rsquo;s lives. &lsquo;Love Heals&rsquo; was an example of me writing for her ministry. As an artist, you search for something to lift up and to lift you up and that just kind of fell in my lap.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As often happens in the music business, Levi eventually secured a recording contract, but the label offered him an out when his project was delayed. He took the opportunity to regroup and get some solid advice from his dad.<\/p>\n<p>Without a trace of bitterness or regret, Levi says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just part of the path. It&rsquo;s so important to me to remember that there&rsquo;s a reason for everything. I feel like I&rsquo;ve taken a journey and become a better artist, musician, and a better songwriter especially.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My dad had multiple record deals, and it really was rough for him,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;&rsquo;God Bless the Broken Road,&rsquo; &lsquo;One of These Days&rsquo;, and two other songs were on his first record. None of them went to radio, nothing happened with them, but those are some of the greatest songs from that era of country music. My dad just stayed true to himself and kept making amazing music and kept writing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had a conversation with my dad the night that I made the decision to walk away from the label and release music independently, and he said, &lsquo;Now you get to figure out how bad you want it and what you&rsquo;re going to do to get it,&rdquo; Levi remembers.<\/p>\n<p>He clearly wants it bad. When the opportunity arose for him to beef up his performance chops, he took it. He smiles and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of opening up for artists like Sam Hunt, Kelsea Ballerini, Dwight Yoakam, Martina McBride, and it&rsquo;s unreal. You go out there, you put your heart on the line, and then you watch the headliner and learn a little bit from each of them. You become an amalgamation of all the people you&rsquo;ve watched before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On the surface, the affable 27-year-old may seem like other young men his age&mdash;one of the guys, a favorite among the girls, a ready smile, a quick wit, and a mischievous twinkle in his eye. But dig a little deeper. He is more than the sum of his parts. When he talks about his future, there is no mention of awards, Platinum albums or chart-topping hits, but instead, there is integrity. He thoughtfully says, &ldquo;I just want to be an artist that sang the songs that he wanted to sing and made the music that he wanted to make who exists in his own lane and isn&rsquo;t competing with anyone else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LeviHummond_11_08_25_AM_5_16_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/levihummonofficial\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/levihummon\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/64fJiKnU2RfnndB8xP3gLi"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/levihummon"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.levihummon.com"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/24\/2019 12:40:47 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-tons-o-fun-band":{"id":"5922","name":"The Tons 'O Fun Band","friendly_url":"the-tons-o-fun-band","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Who is&nbsp;TOFB?<\/p>\n<p>We are an established high energy ensemble that features a full blown horn section and FIVE different lead vocalists, and now is fronted by <strong>Pauli Carman<\/strong> Grammy Nominated, Multi-Platinum Recording Artist, and Lead vocalist of \"Champaign,&rdquo; which had Top 10 Billboard hits in \"How 'Bout Us\", \"Try Again\", and \"Off and On Love\" each of which were preceded by classic music videos reaching top 5 status across the charts on MTV , Vh1, and BET.&nbsp; Headquartered in Champaign\/Urbana\/Danville, Illinois, TOFB appeals to a wide audience and has scores of loyal fans.

The Boston septet&mdash;Ben Stevens [lead vocals], Michael Ricciardulli [guitar], Rami El-Abidin [bass], Christian Rose [violin, vocals], Kamau Burton [acoustic guitar, vocals], Daniel Moss [guitar], and Miles Clyatt [drums]&mdash;perfects this mix on its 2018 independent project.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are so many colors when we play,&rdquo; explains Michael. &ldquo;The chemistry is there in the studio and on stage. When we play to a crowd, it&rsquo;s all organic. The reactions... the faces... the experience, what you see is what you&rsquo;re getting, people know that, they can tell. We&rsquo;ve learned to listen to each other and to what the music has to say. At the same time, we channel our youth, there&rsquo;s no bottling that up. We&rsquo;re always searching for something tangible our listeners can thoroughly feel at the core of the music. We&rsquo;re trying to create an atmosphere much bigger than the seven of us on stage.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It was evident from the band&rsquo;s beginnings that this collective potency could contribute to something far greater, and something truly different. After meeting as freshman at Boston College, Juice became unified upon winning their school&rsquo;s &ldquo;Battle of the Bands&rdquo; in 2014. Soon after, things got serious.<\/p>\n<p>Through constant gigging Juice honed their live performance, displaying an original raw energy. Soon, Juice went from frequent gigs at the city&rsquo;s famed Middle East to selling out East Coast hotspots such as Brighton Music Hall, Mercury Lounge, Rockwood Music Hall, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Releasing their full-length debut in 2016, the band landed a viral hit in the form of &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; which popped up on countless &ldquo;Discover Weekly&rdquo; playlists and cracked over 386,000 Spotify streams without any traditional promotion.<\/p>\n<p>Hitting <em>Summerfest <\/em>Milwaukee for the first time in 2016, Juice impressively won the grand prize at of the festival&rsquo;s &ldquo;Land The Big Gig&rdquo; Competition. Graduating from college a year later, the musicians returned to the annual festival and opened for pop juggernaut DNCE.<\/p>\n<p>Along the way, they carefully sharpened their style, merging virtuosic musicianship and vivid songwriting. &ldquo;The hardest question for us to answer is always who do we sound like. We have so many influences from so many different places. When it all falls together, we end up with songs that are honest, songs that we love, songs people remember...but songs that don&rsquo;t sound like anyone else&rdquo; explains Michael.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a combination of so many things,&rdquo; says Rami. &ldquo;Everyone hears their own impression, first you might hear the violin, then the soulful, dynamic vocals, and then the melody driven guitars, all of which is anchored by our prominent rhythm section.<\/p>\n<p>After meeting GRAMMY&reg; Award-nominated producer Johnny K at Summerfest, the band headed to Milwaukee in 2017 to record their upcoming project. Now, they introduce this collection with the soaring single &ldquo;Sugar.&rdquo; Hummable funk guitars lay over a steady groove before the chantable hook&mdash;&ldquo;<em>I cannot get by without you honey<\/em>&rdquo;&mdash;takes hold. Airtight raps and radiant chorus harmonies drive the song into the bridge before an old school rock n&rsquo; roll guitar solo gives way to stomping handclaps and gospel-style backing vocals.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;On the surface, you can think of &lsquo;<em>Sugar<\/em>&rsquo; traditionally like buying into lust, it&rsquo;s an insatiable feeling&rdquo; explains Michael. &ldquo;It does go a little deeper though. At our age, we experience elements of this vanity culture in high concentration. It speaks to that. There are also elements of temptation in there, but at its core, it&rsquo;s some youths taking a crack at a bright rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Clean guitars unfurl amidst flourishing violin and delicate crooning on the heartfelt &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; On Lovin&rsquo;,&rdquo; which culminates on the admission, &ldquo;<em>I need someone to love<\/em>.&rdquo; Dreamy piano shuffles into a young love confessional on &ldquo;September Told Me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Then, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heartbreak In A Box.&rdquo; An honest statement about &ldquo;<em>holding onto feelings after they&rsquo;ve left your life<\/em>.&rdquo; Michael adds, &ldquo;Sometimes sorrow and pain are the medium in which we recall feelings of joy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good feeling to give listeners something honest, it teaches you a lot.&rdquo; Michael leaves off. &ldquo;You hope someone gives your music a chance, you hope that they might feel something you once felt and make it their own, have their own sensations. We work hard to deliver that&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Juice possesses a power to captivate and move audiences everywhere they go. Something different, moving fast.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Juice_11_15_09_AM_5_15_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"6:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/itstimeforjuice"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/itstimeforjuice\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0Rq1n6pHHHUQwXnCO8IF4E"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/itstimeforjuice"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.itstimeforjuice.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCP7LPalIw2_UWTzGoE0XAow"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/15\/2019 10:05:50 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"clear-pioneer":{"id":"5926","name":"Clear Pioneer","friendly_url":"clear-pioneer","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blending guitar-driven flares and synthesized atmospheres into a sonic Indie Pop package, Clear Pioneer's music and live shows crafted by Grant Clementi, Jesse Carl, and Kyler Schmor reveal a story waiting to be told and aching to be heard.

He wrote, produced and arranged songs that hark back to a time not so different from our current culture; a time when people also needed positive, uplifting release from the vicissitudes of a world changing so quickly.<\/p>\n<p>The melodies were sweet as honey, but the vocals and instruments had an edge that stung like a bee. And thus, The Last Bees was born.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/0m1qcWjOHPb1G3AvA9TONV?si=BQsbAhOvTu20fRY5rJyTfw\">https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/0m1qcWjOHPb1G3AvA9TONV?si=BQsbAhOvTu20fRY5rJyTfw<\/a>M<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TheLastBees_2_53_51_PM_5_15_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"3:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thelastbeesmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_last_bees"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0IVUafI3r4bwgOarF2YzhW?si=OsfmtrLPQWW5hb365Ja_eQ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/the_last_bees"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.thelastbees.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/DE3pEj0tnts"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"05\/23\/2019 03:10:11 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"browns-crew":{"id":"5931","name":"Browns Crew","friendly_url":"browns-crew","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":"<p><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Browns Crew is a Hip Hop duo comprised of Sebas and Chris P, two emcees whose music is influenced by their culture and experience as Mexican Americans.

Perhaps more intriguing are the luminous, flat plate corals found in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.

Efflo represents a rebirth of sorts, building on what came before, but charging forward without looking back. Rigid, but beautiful; challenging, but familiar; and, of course, still dark at its core &ndash; and thus the term &ldquo;death pop&rdquo; was born.<\/p>\n<p>With its beginnings in 2013, when singer-songwriter Sadye Cage was playing small acoustic gigs in her hometown under the band&rsquo;s former moniker, Sc Mira, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the music began to take a darker tone.

The rare tree, nicknamed &ldquo;rose of the west,&rdquo; manages to prevail over the severe climate, opening its beauty to those who seek it.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s with this image that Gina Barrington (vocals, guitar) found solace and inspiration for her project Rose of the West. After five years of false-starts, the contemplative pop outfit has solidified its lineup and will make its debut on April 5<sup>th<\/sup>, with Rose of the West via Communicating Vessels.<\/p>\n<p>Barrington grew up in a musical household, as her grandfather was an orchestra director. She would begrudgingly sit in front of a piano for hours, longing to tinker around and write her own music, and above all work her way through her grandfather&rsquo;s instrument hierarchy to earn her first guitar. And while the guitar was never reached, this foundation is what helped Barrington find her way back to music amidst life&rsquo;s tribulations.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It gave me that space I needed, and encouragement I needed, to maybe just pick something up and see what would happen,&rdquo; Barrington says. &ldquo;It was an expression of that inner voice that you feel like getting out.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After a six-year stint in Los Angeles, Barrington felt Milwaukee calling her home, and her writing began to truly take hold. After releasing a solo EP, Barrington formed Nightgown in 2014, but interpersonal issues permeated the group, and she was left to reinvent. From its ashes came Rose of the West, a dark, dream-pop five-piece.<\/p>\n<p>Rose of the West opens with &ldquo;Love Lies Bleeding,&rdquo; which like the band&rsquo;s name, also draws on the rare beauty of an exotic plant. A hypnotic chorus narrates the universal experience of uncovering a truth and gaining 20\/20 hindsight. Barrington&rsquo;s lush sound is bolstered by the musical backgrounds her band members have brought to Rose of the West: Cedric LeMoyne (Remy Zero, Alanis Morissette), Thomas Gilbert (GGOOLLDD), Erin Wolf (Hello Death) and Dave Power (The Staves).<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s lead single, &ldquo;Roads,&rdquo; is a volatile display of the long journey Barrington had to embark on to arrive at Rose of the West. Barrington&rsquo;s gritty vocals softly-yet-sternly navigate temperamental layers of synth and guitar, ultimately resolving atop an oscillating bassline.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Roads&rsquo; is really about duality: feeling torn, lost, overwhelmed and scared about, yet enthralled with, the possibilities in life,&rdquo; Barrington says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the songs that&rsquo;s been with me longest, and the first one that came together during the making of the album which pointed it, and the band, in its ultimate direction.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The lead up to Rose of the West has been lengthy and turbulent, but Rose of the West is ready to share its sprawling debut. Despite the harsh conditions presented to Barrington, she pressed on and has found her voice with Rose of the West, crafting emotive indie-pop.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_RoseoftheWest_1_18_17_PM_5_27_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 5 - 7:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 5","start_time":"7:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/roseofthewestmusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/roseofthewestmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7jsxrpYrNEgoYrOQ2gChdf"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_RoseOfTheWest_"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.roseofthewest.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCbl_1Tabph6iYcow-dB2lGw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/18\/2019 04:30:29 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"tristen":{"id":"5981","name":"Tristen","friendly_url":"tristen","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 5","description":"<p>The mononymous singer hailing from Nashville, Tenn., released 2011&rsquo;s Charlatans at the Garden Gate and 2013&rsquo;s CAVES to critical acclaim.

At 15 years old, the gifted young Irish-American is already thinking deeply about her world &ndash; and how she can truly make an impact. &ldquo;I just want my fans to realize they&rsquo;re never alone, and that my music is always something they can turn to,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re ever feeling alone, my music is there for them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since the age of 3, Queeva &ndash; who&rsquo;s name means beauty, grace and gentleness in Gaelic &ndash; has known she was different. That&rsquo;s when her Irish-immigrant parents and five siblings noticed she could memorize and sing entire songs perfectly, especially ones by the great Dolly Parton. By the age of 7 she was competing in talent shows all around the country, and developing a taste for sharing her soul. &ldquo;I would look up to Taylor Swift and saw how she was writing her own music and inspiring people,&rdquo; Queeva says. &ldquo;I wanted to do something like that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Building a love for country song craft just as vibrant as the fables of her ancestral home, Queeva&rsquo;s career got a jumpstart when she was introduced to Nashville hit maker Jamie O&rsquo;Neal (&ldquo;When I Think About Angels,&rdquo; &ldquo;There Is No Arizona&rdquo;). Working one-on-one, they began to pen songs defined by themes of hope and belonging, combining Queeva&rsquo;s mission to inspire with a distinct worldliness earned by her travels to Ireland each summer.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Most of the time, my music is positive and upbeat,&rdquo; she admits, &ldquo;but my sound is unique. It does have an edge.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also boldly diverse. Her debut album [INSERT TITLE] features a rich wealth of influence &ndash; from the Celtic roots of modern country to the striking pop flavors of today&rsquo;s Top 40 hits. In 2017 Queeva began releasing the singles &ldquo;Live Like a Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand Out&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who You Really Are,&rdquo; all of which featured top-notch sonic exploration and true-to-oneself messaging.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As I was growing up and making new friends at school, I always felt like I had to blend in,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;I was seeing girls change themselves because they wanted to be like other people, and I thought maybe by writing these songs I could help remind them they should be themselves &ndash; because sometimes I need to be reminded of that, too.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the shadowy hue of Queeva&rsquo;s &ldquo;How Do You Know&rdquo; takes a different approach, applying haunting vocals to a story about knowing true love when you see it &ndash; no matter how old you are. Backed by traditional instruments and featuring an unforgettably textured chorus harmony, the track is once again aimed at supporting her peers through dark times.<\/p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;&rsquo;<\/em>How do You Know&rsquo; is a song that talks about young love, and how teenagers <em>can<\/em> be in love for real,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;A lot of adults will hear that and think &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, and you have no clue what love is.&rsquo; But I wanted to write this song to say that it <em>is<\/em> possible.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just another example of Queeva&rsquo;s ability to speak truth across generational divides, offering musical understanding to both sides. In 2019 she&rsquo;ll do so with the release of her new album, and with a batch of cinematic music videos which each feature inspirational undercurrents. But perhaps most importantly she&rsquo;ll do so on the road, taking her message to teenagers around the country on the High School Nation tour. &ldquo;I feel like my music is exactly who I am,&rdquo; she says about her drive to be a positive role model. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going to give up.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Queeva_9_15_59_AM_6_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Queevaofficial\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/queevamusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7BDSrECxsc6RyFL2qFkomJ?si=0Kz0MYcoTZWrv_njVwgeGQ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/queevamusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.queevamusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCp1MFzjUs85qdCod4lnmjbg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/12\/2019 09:16:07 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"funkee-jbeez":{"id":"5988","name":"Funkee JBeez","friendly_url":"funkee-jbeez","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":"<p>The FunkeeJBeez is a Clyde Stubblefield tribute band based out of Madison, Wisconsin and led by musical director and Grammy nominated drummer Joey B.

Un-yielded by what's trendy, Casey Virock (guitars\/vocals) with Greg Norton (bass) and Ian Prince (drums) derive some of their inspiration from 70's classic rock and 60's British psychedelica, resulting in a Swervedriver meets Queens of The Stone Age type sound.<\/p>\n<p>Porcupine was founded in early 2006 by Casey Virock. Hoping to spring board off recent success from his former band Space Bike, including opening slots for Frank Black, The Descendants, The Melvins, The Jesus Lizard and Everclear, Porcupine began touring and playing the Midwest. Ian Prince has been supplying the backbone for top-notch indie bands like Story of the Sea, Houston and Kid Dakota for well over a decade. Possessing the perfect combination of play-for-the-song sensibility and an \"all or nothing\" attitude, Prince is an undeniable powerhouse on the drums.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 10 years Porcupine has continued to build momentum. They have released two full length LP's, 2 EPs, multiple singles, a record charting at #115 in the CMJ top 200, opening slots with the Meat Puppets, Mission of Burma, Shiner, The Life and Times, and songs featured on T.V. shows, such as,&nbsp;<em>The Real World<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Best Ink<\/em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Challenge<\/em>.

That year marked the anniversary of their 1997 self-titled debut album, which included the hit single &ldquo;Sex and Candy&rdquo;. In celebration of the anniversary, Slow Down Sounds released the album on vinyl for the first time ever. The album went platinum back in 1997, selling 1.4 million copies, while the radio classic &ldquo;Sex and Candy&rdquo; spent a then record 15 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart.<\/p>\n<p>In the interim years Marcy Playground released four posterior albums &ldquo;Shapeshifter&rdquo; (1999), &ldquo;Marcy Playground 3&rdquo; (MP3) (2004), &ldquo;Leaving Wonderland&hellip; In A Fit of Rage&rdquo; (2009), &nbsp;and &ldquo;Lunch, Recess, and Detention&rdquo; (2012). The albums demonstrated tremendous periods of creative growth for the group and are recognized as &ldquo;cult classics&rdquo; among the band&rsquo;s dedicated fans. The band has also enjoyed notice by the big screen. Their songs are featured on soundtracks such as <strong>Cruel Intentions<\/strong>, <strong>Antitrust<\/strong>, <strong>Simply Irresistible<\/strong>, <strong>Hurricane Streets<\/strong>, as well as many films by writer\/director Kevin Smith (<strong>Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back<\/strong>, <strong>Zack and Miri Make a Porno<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p>Marcy Playground has recently toured with Everclear, Fuel, Dishwalla, Local H and more.

Then <em>Malevolence<\/em> dropped, it was sort of our punch in the dick to the music industry, and we did our first headlining tour in 2015.&rdquo; <em>Malevolence<\/em> hit #45 on the <em>Billboard<\/em> 200 and thanks to singles including \"Defame Me\" and &ldquo;Kill Or Be Killed,\" and along with stints on the Warped Tour and a festival tour with Halestorm, NYD honed a sound that, on <em>Unbreakable<\/em>, melds &ldquo;the super-melodic and the dirty, ratchety stuff.&rdquo; Writers\/producers Mitch Marlow (All That Remains, In This Moment) and Scott Stevens (Halestorm, Shinedown) wrote with Costello, honing her focus. &ldquo;You put the two guys together, and I&rsquo;m the person who embodies both sides, musically.

A cohesive collection of modern folk music, Secondhand Smoke asks provocative questions about how we become who we are, what and whom we love, and the growth, pain, and freedom that come with accepting that some answers might elude us forever.<br \/><br \/>\"The older I get, the more I find that is what it's all about -- that there is no way to answer it all,\" Sean says. \"Being comfortable with mystery is a positive thing in all aspects of our lives. I definitely explore that in these songs.\"<br \/><br \/>A grassroots following now hundreds of thousands deep has turned to Sean for that kind of musical exploration for almost 20 years. Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Meat Loaf, Jake Owen, Brothers Osborne, Christina Aguilera, Buddy Miller and more have all recorded his songs -- a dizzying list that spans not just styles, but generations. Success shows no sign of slowing: Sean earned his first no. 1 single on country charts in early 2018 with breakout artist Brett Young's delivery of \"Mercy,\" which the two co-wrote. As a performer, Sean packs listening rooms and quiets unruly bar crowds. His sound -- a warm tenor painting vivid stories over acoustic guitar often cushioned by keys or other strings -- has prompted a diverse range of music scenes from the storied Boston folk community to Texas's defiantly self-sovereign camp to warmly claim Sean as one of their own.<br \/><br \/>\"My payoff is just making the music,\" Sean says, then smiles. \"Everything else is bonus.\"<br \/><br \/>At 34 years-old, Sean has the catalog of artists twice his age. He released his first album at just 15, and until his acclaimed eponymous record in 2015, he did it all independently. \"Bootstrapping your own career, you get to build at an organic pace that allows you to grow with your music,\" he says. \"It teaches you how most musicians do it. Overnight success is not the rule -- it's the exception. Most of us are doing it the other way.\"<br \/><br \/>Sean's first lessons in bootstrapping came from watching his parents, two professional musicians in Massachusetts. \"I remember being obsessed with the smallest things, like the gig bag my dad would put all his gear in -- his cables, his capos, and his strings,\" Sean says. \"Everything about music appealed to me. From an early age, I was just taken with it.\" He picked up guitar and began writing about 10 -- around the same time his family moved from Massachusetts to Georgia. He still remembers the first song he wrote. \"It was called 'Paper People,'\" he says, with a laugh. \"I wrote it when we moved. It was about dealing with those feelings of leaving family and meeting all these people I didn't know.\" Typical 10-year-old song fodder.<br \/><br \/>Secondhand Smoke is a stunning portrait of that Argus-eyed little boy, all grown up and grappling with what that entails. Recorded and produced by Sean over two months in his home studio, the album is a bona fide musical rarity: a 12-song set given time to marinate in its artist's often isolated care. Excluding strings and synths, Sean played the instruments on the record. He co-wrote three songs and wrote the rest alone. The result is an intimate look not just at a moment in Sean's life, but at unhurried creativity's potential. \"It was an amazingly intoxicating experience,\" Sean says of the process. \"This time around, there was no clock. I could create when the inspiration hit -- it could be two or three in the morning. It felt amazing. Total creative freedom. No middle man, no reason for me not to see every thought through to completion.\"<br \/><br \/>Brooding track \"I Could Have been an Angel\" sets the album's tone: a reimagined 40 days shared by Jesus and the devil, wherein Satan wistfully points to his own promising beginning, shattered. The two set a pattern that is played out between humans next. The song is achingly sad, punctuated by mournful strings and carried by Sean's sublime vocals. \"That image in the first verse with Jesus and the devil flows into this bigger picture of how any of us could be anybody else, and how our circumstances dictate who we are and why,\" Sean says.<br \/><br \/>Sean has a way of taking familiar stories -- often with biblical roots -- and revealing what they say about all of us now. In Sean's hands, tales that once felt specific, or even narrow and unapproachably religious, unfold into universal longing and exchanges that feel like they were pulled yesterday from our own backyards. Clean and snarling electric guitar kicks off \"Rest My Head,\" as Sean explores compromise to haunting effect. He starts with Judas then turns relentlessly inward. \"These are stories that people are familiar with, and they steer the ship in a certain direction, then leave you off at this ocean of possibilities that we didn't plan on the story taking us to,\" Sean says.<br \/><br \/>With its easy intelligence, lyrical cadence, and clear vocals dotted by \"woo-oohs,\" \"Here We Go\" demands comparisons to Paul Simon. \"Wrong Side of Town\" occupies the same rarified air. Over moody keys, Sean describes unfulfilled hopes born in a place defined by rust. \"Greetings from Niagara Falls\" explores how lonely following a dream can be. Standout \"Shaky Bridges\" pokes holes in the illusion of perfection and black-and-white choices. Gospel-tinged harmony singers back Sean's honeyed delivery to create a goosebumps-inducing message that comforts even as it undermines what we think we know.<br \/><br \/>Distorted and brimming with desperation, \"Say Goodbye\" picks up on subtle changes that could foreshadow a relationship's end. Featuring elaborate imagery, \"The Devil's Ball\" reaches for love after rejection. Sweeping \"I Don't Want to Know\" pleads for more of the same, whether it's real or not, while empathetic \"Another Song about a Broken Heart\" recalls an ill-fated affair.<br \/><br \/>Imbued with grace that winsome strings help convey, \"Everything That's Good\" is a stunning love song, written for Sean's daughter. He calls it out as a favorite, along with the album's title track. Cigarettes lit during rides in a smoky sedan bring a relationship between father and son to life. The song is personal, painful, beautiful, and forgiving.<br \/><br \/>\"Music is a nuanced and multilevel experience,\" Sean says. \"Fewer and fewer people are taking the time to sit down and really listen to a song. I hope people give this record that space, and then just go on that journey -- whatever that journey is, because it's going to be different for everybody. I think that's what music does best.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/StageGraphics\/16.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialseanmcconnell"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sean_mcconnell\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/42N7nSYb8pRmVpBpkLSHVC"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sean_mcconnell"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.seanmcconnell.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC5No1vRhJmYh6ukPchebiHA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/23\/2019 08:33:00 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"hot-coffin":{"id":"6060","name":"Hot Coffin","friendly_url":"hot-coffin","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 29","description":"<p>It&rsquo;s fitting that within 24 hours of rounding up what we consider to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/milwaukeerecord.com\/music\/the-25-best-milwaukee-albums-of-2015\/\"><strong>the 25 best Milwaukee albums of 2015<\/strong><\/a>, Milwaukee&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/hotcoffin.bandcamp.com\/\"><strong>Hot Coffin<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;unveils a song that, if any indication of the caliber of the other seven songs on the forthcoming release, is likely to be one of the 25 best Milwaukee albums of 2016. &ldquo;Whistle, Hawk &amp; Spit&rdquo; is the first single from the rock quartet&rsquo;s self-titled album that&rsquo;s due out in January.&nbsp;<em>Hot Coffin&nbsp;<\/em>will be the band&rsquo;s first full release since putting out its debut full-length,&nbsp;<em>LAW,&nbsp;<\/em>in early 2013, and the first with longtime Disguised As Birds singer&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/milwaukeerecord.com\/music\/chris-chuzles-breathes-new-life-hot-coffin\/\">Chris Chuzles<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On &ldquo;Whistle, Hawk &amp; Spit,&rdquo; Chuzles makes his presence known with his familiar ominous and imposing vocal timbre that, when merged with the driving, no-nonsense guitar licks of Christian Hansen (Whips) and the raucous rhythm section composed of Joe Kanack (Red Knife Lottery), Ben Davison (Get Rad) and Jon Kraft (Since By Man), brings about exactly 200 seconds of delightful devastation.

From charting on Spotify's US and Canada Viral 50 Playlists, performing at the NAMM shows in both Nashville and Anaheim, and selling out shows in Atlanta, Birmingham, Huntsville, Nashville, Auburn and more, the band has had an exhilarating start.<br \/><br \/>Originally an acoustic duo, Alec and Joseph started turning heads in local venues with clean vocals and expert guitar work. John noticed the talent and potential of the duo and offered to play drums and sing with the guys.

Hailing from the musical mecca of Athens, Georgia, Walden emerged as the city&rsquo;s newest rock sound. The band quickly captured the college town&rsquo;s attention, taking them from a debut performance at a Pizza Hut to a headline show at the historic Georgia Theatre just two years later. Comprised of Richard Becker (vocals\/guitar), Jamie de Lange (bass), Eric Hangartner (vocals\/piano) and Andrew Mendel (drums) the quartet has remained just that ever since. While each share a dream of traveling the world creating music, they are drawn together by a common understanding of what&rsquo;s truly sacred: the band.<\/p>\n<p>6 years after its inception, Walden has burst onto the scene with many major festival appearances, including two years in a row at Bonnaroo, a main stage performance at Sloss Music &amp; Arts Festival, as well as directly supporting names including Moon Taxi and Twiddle. These four young men have quickly become one of the biggest upcoming musical acts in the southeast, capturing the attention of audiences of all ages with their raw sound, infectious energy, and the undeniable connection they share on stage.<\/p>\n<p>2019 already looks to be the biggest year yet for Walden. In addition to announcing their new EP, The Static, they are slated to play the Shaky Knees Music Festival, followed by a subsequent headlining tour in April and May.<\/p>\n<p>Walden&rsquo;s new EP, The Static, chronicles the band&rsquo;s attempt to navigate through the perpetual noise that pervades everyday life in search of something else&mdash;something of true purpose and meaning which brings one a sense of truly feeling alive.

Nashville-based songstress&nbsp;<strong>Lucie Silvas<\/strong>&nbsp;unapologetically personifies a spirit of freedom. Like a well-traveled rolling stone, her music threads together an Americana patchwork of retro-fitted pop and countrified rock, echoing sweet Motown soul, dripping dirty Delta blues, and reflecting Laurel Canyon bliss. However, her independence behind-the-scenes makes such sonic fearlessness possible in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>When it came time to record her fourth full-length&nbsp;<em>E.G.O.<\/em>, she took the reins, overseeing not only the creation as a performer, multi-instrumentalist, and co-producer, but also spearheading the resources and logistics under her own Furthest Point label. Out of a cozy East Nashville studio, she put everything on the line in order to create unbeholden to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;anyone watching<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a result, the album embodies the enviable ideal of a confident woman in control of her own destiny.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Going into the studio, I felt like a college kid again,&rdquo; she smiles. &ldquo;I was doing this with no record company, A&amp;R guys, or managers around. It was as if I&rsquo;d been given the keys to a place I really wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be. I made what I wanted. For me, it had to be totally different from any other female artist out there, because of all the things I love. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about trends or what&rsquo;s hot at the moment. I didn&rsquo;t care. I was doing something that made me happy. I needed to do this without worrying about any external opinions. So, I did.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>However, she sowed the seeds for such a body of work long ago. Raised between the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the songstress lived in both countries throughout her formative years. Moreover, she educated herself on everyone from Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland to Hank Williams, Sr., Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, the Four Seasons, and Rolling Stones by combing through an extensive vinyl collection amassed by mom and dad. Kicking off a successful solo career in 2000, her discography grew to include&nbsp;<em>Breathe In<\/em>&nbsp;[2004],&nbsp;<em>The Same Side<\/em>&nbsp;[2006], and&nbsp;<em>Letters to Ghosts<\/em>&nbsp;[2015]. Not to mention, she captivated fans on tour alongside Chris Stapleton, James Bay, Little Big Town, Miranda Lambert, and many more. In Europe alone, she sold over one million albums throughout this time and toured with Elton John, Macy Gray, and more. Settling in Nashville, she stands out as the only British-born act making waves today.<\/p>\n<p>When she hit that Nashville studio alongside&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;best friend<\/em>&rdquo; and co-producer Jon Green [James Bay, Linkin Park], Lucie walked in with a crystal-clear idea in mind&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I said,&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;I could picture us getting into a time machine from 1967 and arriving in 2034, and that&rsquo;s how I want the record to sound&rsquo;<\/em>,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;I needed it to have a modern approach, but still be roots-y and real. There&rsquo;s an old school sensibility. Jon was on the same page. He knew exactly what I wanted the music to be and who I wanted to be. You can&rsquo;t do something new by just copying, so we searched for a way to make everything fresh. It&rsquo;s a combination of the styles I love, but it feels contemporary. We were trying to build something old that could exist in a new world.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That sound immediately resonated amongst fans and tastemakers alike upon arrival.&nbsp;<em>NPR<\/em>&nbsp;premiered the album as part of its prestigious &ldquo;First Listen&rdquo; initiative, and further acclaim came from&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone Country<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>, and more straight out of the gate.<\/p>\n<p>Her vision unfolded seamlessly over the course of the tracks themselves. The opener &ldquo;Kite&rdquo; takes to the sky on the winds of a stomping groove, wild accordion, chapel-ready backing vocals, and an equally hummable guitar solo courtesy of Lucie&rsquo;s husband and six-string virtuoso John Osborne [The Brothers Osborne]. A Spaghetti Western-style rustle brushes up against her simmering smoky croon on &ldquo;Girls from California&rdquo; where she sings,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;He only wants those girls from California<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the title track &ldquo;E.G.O.&rdquo; skewers our society&rsquo;s addiction to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;social media likes&rdquo;<\/em>&nbsp;as it struts forward on a cheeky and funked-up refrain,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Everybody gets off&hellip;on the fame and the glory. Trying to chase out the lonely. We wanna be loved, we want it right now<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em>&nbsp; Osborne once again lends his fret talents to the fore.<\/p>\n<p>On the 2019 single &ldquo;Black Jeans,&rdquo; she slips into a dusty and dynamic delivery that&rsquo;s as wonderfully worn and comfortable as your favorite denim. The jazz-y cadence floats over a slide guitar cry and steady drums.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;After worrying about how other people perceived me for so long, this is a little, subtle&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Fuck You&rsquo;<\/em>&nbsp;to anyone who thinks they know everything about me at first glance,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a liberating song that says,&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;This is what I&rsquo;m doing.

It&rsquo;s a freeing moment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Everything crescendos towards the confessional closer &ldquo;Change My Mind&rdquo; where Lucie details a personal revelation by way of lyrical intimacy and delicate delivery.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was always set in my ways,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d get married. I never thought I&rsquo;d do anything traditional. Instead, I always fought tradition. I wanted my life to be completely mine. Then, my husband came along and changed my perspective! It&rsquo;s a heartfelt and honest way to say there&rsquo;s a possibility someone can always come along and change everything about the way we think. That&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>By unabashedly embracing herself and her creativity, Lucie ultimately transfers that freedom to audiences.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you listen to me, I want you to come away feeling inspired to do whatever you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; she leaves off. &ldquo;I want to motivate.&nbsp; So much music has inspired me. I&rsquo;ve felt comfort in countless artists. It&rsquo;s not about the noise around in the world and the comings and goings; it&rsquo;s about the moment of escaping and just listening. I&rsquo;d love for you to embrace what you love about yourself and music.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LucieSilvas_10_49_28_AM_6_12_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 30 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 30","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LucieSilvasMusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/luciesilvas\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/57HiMjhnxdJflQodRyC5Ju"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LucieSilvas"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/luciesilvas.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/issisilvas"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/19\/2019 10:51:08 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"bootleg-bessie":{"id":"6085","name":"Bootleg Bessie","friendly_url":"bootleg-bessie","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 27","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BootlegBessie_2_21_08_PM_6_14_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 12:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"12:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/22\/2019 11:56:07 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"phil-seed":{"id":"6089","name":"Phil Seed","friendly_url":"phil-seed","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PhilSeed_2_21_46_PM_6_14_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 2 - 2:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 2","start_time":"2:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/19\/2019 07:09:12 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"friday-pilots-club":{"id":"6090","name":"Friday Pilots Club","friendly_url":"friday-pilots-club","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 6","description":"<p>Based in Chicago, Friday Pilots Club is a cohesive Indie Rock band drenched in reverb and glistening guitars.

For the next twelve months, I did nothing but write for nine hours a day, every single day.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Kennedy clearly sensed he was on to something special with &ldquo;Fire Alarm,&rdquo; but little did he know he&rsquo;d just written the tune that would lead the Sydney rockers halfway around the world and propel them from local favorites to international breakout stars. With its driving beat and earworm of a melody, &ldquo;Fire Alarm&rdquo; was a runaway hit on Spotify, where it reached #6 on the Global Viral chart and racked up more than five million streams. The band garnered airplay everywhere from Australia&rsquo;s legendary alternative music station, Triple J to LA&rsquo;s KROQ to SiriusXM&rsquo;s ALT Nation and drew comparisons to The Strokes and Daft Punk, with&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone Australia&nbsp;<\/em>praising their &ldquo;amalgamation of emotion and unashamed catchiness.&rdquo; The band played more than 500 shows and festival dates Down Under, building up a devoted fanbase and honing their set into a concentrated blast of pure energy and ecstasy. By the time they got to SXSW in 2017,&nbsp;<strong>Castlecomer&nbsp;<\/strong>was ready to take America by storm.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know anybody in the industry,&rdquo; says Bede, &ldquo;but we felt confident that if we had the opportunity to get onstage in front of a lot of people, that would be enough. We played eight shows in three days and just tore it up. From those gigs, we got management, a record deal, publishing, and a booking agent. We&rsquo;re like the poster boys for what you can still achieve at South by Southwest.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Castlecomer&nbsp;<\/strong>has never been lacking when it comes to drive and ambition, and their tenacious belief in the potential of their band goes all the way back to its earliest days. Consisting of four cousins and a close childhood friend, the group began playing live during their teenage years and took their band name from a plaque mounted outside their grandfather&rsquo;s house, one they later found out referenced the Irish village his family had emigrated from. Much like the band&rsquo;s music, their name possesses deep personal meaning while still retaining an air of evocative mystery, hinting at places they&rsquo;ve never been but still somehow course through their veins.<\/p>\n<p>Australia&rsquo;s in their blood, too, and Sydney will always be home, but after signing with Concord Records, the band took a leap of faith in early 2018 and moved to Nashville.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We wanted to live in a 24\/7 music community,&rdquo; says Kennedy. &ldquo;As soon we arrived, we discovered that there was live music happening from 1pm onwards in every bloody corner of the place. It was exactly what we needed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Despite their newfound love for Music City,&nbsp;<strong>Castlecomer&nbsp;<\/strong>won&rsquo;t be spending too much time there this year considering the already-extensive headline and festival dates lined up behind their<\/p>\n<p>track, &ldquo;Move.&rdquo; Recorded with producer Adrian Breakspear (Gang of Youths) and mastered by GRAMMY-winner Joe LaPorta (The Weeknd, The Killers, Foo Fighters), the track is a funky dance jam that pairs Kennedy&rsquo;s silky-smooth vocals with a disco-tinged arrangement that&rsquo;s pure 1970&rsquo;s bliss.<\/p>\n<p>Such is the contagious energy of&nbsp;<strong>Castlecomer<\/strong>. One listen and you&rsquo;re hooked, sucked into their rapturous world of angular guitars and hypnotizing grooves. With a sound this meticulous and infectious, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that the band hasn&rsquo;t even released their debut LP yet, but these singles are only the tip of the iceberg from a group that&rsquo;s doggedly determined to fulfill every bit of their seemingly limitless potential. It&rsquo;s already been a wild ride, but&nbsp;<strong>Castlecomer&nbsp;<\/strong>is just getting started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Castlecomer is:<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;Bede &ndash; vocals Tommy &ndash; guitar Neely &ndash; keyboards Joe &ndash; bass Patch &ndash; drums<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Castlecomer_5_15_11_PM_6_17_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 4 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 4","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/castlecomer"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/castlecomer\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7tnWJfXaJmFO6vv5WFN2K0"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/castlecomerband"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/castlecomermusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/CASTLECOMERmusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/25\/2019 12:22:28 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"tle--top-10":{"id":"6111","name":"TLE \/ Top 10","friendly_url":"tle--top-10","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 28","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TLETop10_8_58_51_AM_6_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 28 - 7:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 28","start_time":"7:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/26\/2019 07:15:51 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-paradigm-drumline-performing-the-wiz":{"id":"6117","name":"The Paradigm Drumline performing \"The Wiz\"","friendly_url":"the-paradigm-drumline-performing-the-wiz","stages":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","dates":"07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 3","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ParadigmDrumlineThe_6_23_00_PM_6_19_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 12:45 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"12:45 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 2:15 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"2:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/25\/2019 04:26:01 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"beat-council":{"id":"6112","name":"Beat Council","friendly_url":"beat-council","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 4","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BeatCouncil_9_01_54_AM_6_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 12:30 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"12:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Beatcouncil262\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/21\/2019 09:01:56 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lainey-wilson":{"id":"6119","name":"Lainey Wilson","friendly_url":"lainey-wilson","stages":"us-cellular-connection-stage","dates":"07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Lainey Wilson&rsquo;s music is by equal measures richly textured and forthright &ndash; much like her honeyed Louisiana drawl, which is as likely to offer you a warm word of encouragement as it is to call you on your bullshit. Signed to BBR Music Group&rsquo;s flagship imprint, Broken Bow Records, Wilson has spent years honing her song craft and developing her own &ldquo;bell bottom country&rdquo; sound, which is unapologetic, gritty, free-spirited, and exemplary of both her personality and her preferred fashion aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Her songs and live performances are anchored in straightforward, raw emotion that doesn&rsquo;t beat around the bush about who Lainey Wilson is - either as a person or an artist. <em>NPR&rsquo;s<\/em> Jewly Hight calls Wilson &ldquo;unabashedly down-home and unflappably worldly,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;with a pronounced drawl and sweetened sting, [she sings] of willful recklessness, wielding the power of damaging secrets and feeling empowered by allowing herself outbursts of irreverence.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s these sensibilities that continue to draw listeners to Wilson&rsquo;s music and led CMT to proclaim her one of their &ldquo;Next Women of Country&rdquo; for 2019. She&rsquo;s a blue-collar daughter filled with ambition, humility, and perseverance; the value of an honest day&rsquo;s work having been ingrained in her from the moment she could walk.<\/p>\n<p>Hailing from the rural farming community of Baskin, Louisiana (pop. 300), where her family has tilled the land for five generations, Wilson cultivated her tenacious work ethic just as her family cultivated corn, wheat, soybeans, oats, and more. She learned that daily chores on the farm were a family affair, and every member had to do their part.<\/p>\n<p>Music was also a family affair. Wilson&rsquo;s father played guitar, her mother loved to dance, and her grandparents often took her to bluegrass festivals. She wrote her first song at age nine, and her dad taught her how to play guitar at age 11. Wilson&rsquo;s love for writing and performing continued to grow as she booked herself gigs throughout high school, even working for a stint as a Hannah Montana impersonator performing at children&rsquo;s birthday parties and events &ndash; with Lainey Wilson the artist opening for Montana, of course.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until Wilson moved to Nashville to pursue her dream of making music, with little more to her name than that dream and a Flagstaff bumper-pull travel trailer. She lived in that camper outside of a longtime family friend&rsquo;s recording studio for three years. It was during this time that Wilson began to make inroads with Nashville&rsquo;s tight-knit songwriting community, forging invaluable creative relationships with other up-and-coming songwriters in town and steadily developing her own voice as both a writer and an artist.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My songs are a part of who I am. As my artistry has grown, it&rsquo;s just kind of taught me not to be ashamed of who I am. To love <em>everything<\/em> about my life &ndash; even the harder parts - because all those things make me who I am. And that&rsquo;s true for everybody,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We never want to go through the hard times, but I&rsquo;m thankful for the ones I&rsquo;ve had. I&rsquo;ve gotten the songs I have from those experiences, and I&rsquo;ve found that the more vulnerable I am and the more truthful I am, whether it is funny or sad or whatever -- the more I am myself, the more people will honestly connect with me and my music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Wilson&rsquo;s determined openness and salt-of-the-earth upbringing has prepared her well for the year ahead. She is starting 2019 with a supporting slot on chart-topping artist Morgan Wallen&rsquo;s <em>If I Know Me Tour<\/em> before going in-studio to record her first project for Broken Bow Records. The year ahead may be full of early mornings, late nights, and many more firsts for the charismatic singer\/songwriter, but Wilson remains undaunted &ndash; energized, even - by the long days ahead of her.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where I come from, there are years when you get a plentiful crop. Then there are years when you get too much rain, or not enough. Either way, you still have to get up every morning at the crack of dawn to take care of your crops. It&rsquo;s the same with music,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We get up every single day and we work toward that good crop, no matter how hard. And we do what it takes, because it&rsquo;s in our blood, and we don&rsquo;t know any other way.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LaineyWilson_8_47_48_AM_6_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/laineywilsonmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/laineywilsonmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6tPHARSq45lQ8BSALCfkFC?si=OYmxn9eLQ4KqMZ1Zgt38vQ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/laineywilson"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/laineywilson.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/LaineyWilson?sub_confirmation=1"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/21\/2019 11:25:48 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lafam-360":{"id":"6120","name":"LaFam 360","friendly_url":"lafam-360","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"07-02","long_dates":"July 2","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 2","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LaFam360_9_00_38_AM_6_21_2019.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 2 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 2","start_time":"6:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/store.summerfest.com\/2019-summerfest-general-admission-ticket"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"06\/21\/2019 09:00:50 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"dj-bizzon":{"id":"6115","name":"DJ Bizzon","friendly_url":"dj-bizzon","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 7","description":"<p>Since 2017, DJ Bizzon has been an on-air personality at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee.
